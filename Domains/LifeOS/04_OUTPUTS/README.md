# Outputs Folder

Generated reports and exports appear here.

## Purpose

This folder contains output files generated by life-management workflows:
- Life summary reports from `export` workflow
- Extraction reports from `extract` workflow

## Naming Convention

- Life summaries: `life_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Extraction reports: `extraction_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Usage

- Run `*export` or "generate life summary" to create a report
- Reports are never overwritten - each gets a unique timestamp
- Review past reports to track your evolution over time
