# Assets Folder

Drop raw notes, ideas, and journal entries here for extraction.

## Purpose

This folder serves as an inbox for unprocessed content. The `extract` workflow scans files here and routes insights to the appropriate life files.

## Supported Formats

- Markdown (`.md`)
- Text (`.txt`)

## Workflow

1. Add notes/ideas to this folder
2. Run `*extract` or "process my notes"
3. Review extracted insights
4. Approve to update life files
5. Notes are archived or marked as extracted

## Tips

- Use descriptive filenames: `2026-02-15_career_thoughts.md`
- Don't worry about formatting - extraction handles categorization
- Write naturally - the workflow looks for intent patterns
