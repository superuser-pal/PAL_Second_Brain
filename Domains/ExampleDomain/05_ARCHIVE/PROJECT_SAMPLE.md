# Sample Project

This file demonstrates an archived project with the required deprecation header.

## Deprecation Header Format

When archiving files, prepend this header:

```yaml
---
deprecated: YYYY-MM-DD
reason: Project completed | Superseded by [FILE] | No longer relevant | Cancelled
original_location: [original folder path]
---
```

## Original Content

This section shows what the project file looked like before archiving.

### Objective

Demonstrate the archive_domain workflow and deprecation pattern.

### Tasks

- [x] Create project file
- [x] Complete project work
- [x] Archive with deprecation header

## Archive Rules

- Files in `05_ARCHIVE/` preserve their original names
- Deprecation header is prepended, not replacing content
- INDEX.md Active Work table is updated when archiving projects
