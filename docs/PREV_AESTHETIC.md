# Art Skill Aesthetic

**Clean Line Art with Spot Color** - A friendly, approachable, and tech-forward aesthetic for professional visual content and infographics.

---

## Core Style

**Visual Language:** Clean, medium-weight line art with a "Spot Color" focus.

- **Hand-drawn feel:** Smooth, consistent lines with slightly rounded terminals.
- **Minimalist:** High use of negative space (white) to reduce cognitive load.
- **Hero-Centric:** Use of brand purple is reserved strictly for the primary actions and focus points.
- **Stipple Shading:** Depth is created through fine dots (stippling) rather than gradients.

**Influences:**

- Modern technical illustrations
- Minimalist vector art
- Classic comic-book stippling
- Friendly, approachable SaaS branding

## Color System

| Role                 | Hex       | Functional Usage                                                                 |
| :------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Canvas**           | `#FFFFFF` | The primary workspace background; provides maximum contrast.                     |
| **Primary Accent**   | `#7450db` | High-priority focal points: mascot body, main buttons, and key callouts.         |
| **Secondary Accent** | `#AF9BFF` | Low-priority accents: supportive flows, connection lines, and mascot highlights. |
| **Primary Text**     | `#1A1A1A` | All readable content, including titles, labels, and paragraph text.              |
| **Structural Fill**  | `#F3F4F6` | Depth elements: cards, panel backgrounds, or subtle environmental fills.         |
| **Definition Line**  | `#000000` | The "skeleton": used for all borders, outlines, and hand-drawn stroke work.      |

## Color Usage Guidelines

### Ratios

- **Canvas (White)**: 60-70% (Maintains a clean, airy feel)
- **Definition Line (Black)**: 20-25% (Framework and character outlines)
- **Primary Accent (Purple)**: 5-10% (The "Spot Color" rule—used for the hero element)
- **Secondary Accent (Lavender)**: 2-5% (Subtle highlights or secondary paths)

### Rules

1. **White is the default** - Never use dark backgrounds for primary content.
2. **The "Spot Color" Focus** - Only the mascot and primary CTA buttons should be `#7450db`.
3. **Monochrome Environment** - Human characters, furniture, and tools must remain strictly Black & White.
4. **No Gradients** - Use solid fills or stippled textures for shading.
5. **High Contrast Text** - Always use `#1A1A1A` for readability; never use purple for long-form text.

## Illustration Characteristics

### Line Quality

- **Consistent Weight** - Medium thickness across the entire piece.
- **Smooth Terminals** - Ends of lines should be slightly rounded, not sharp or jagged.
- **Closed Shapes** - Lines should connect cleanly to allow for solid color fills.

### Shading & Depth

- **Stippling** - Use fine black or purple dots to indicate shadow on the underside of objects.
- **Flat Fills** - No 3D bevels or drop shadows. Depth is achieved through line work and stipple density.

### Character Design

- **The Mascot (PromptPal)** - Purple-toned robot with a single "squircle" (rounded square) body-head unit and no separate torso; features a centered bulb-tipped antenna, oversized white circular eyes with black dot pupils, and a versatile thick black line mouth; limbs are matching purple, segmented accordion-style tubes with four-fingered hands.
- **Humanity** - Clean-lined vector figures with uniform black outlines and flat greyscale fills, featuring dot eyes, expressive eyebrows for clear emotion, solid-silhouette hair, and professional-casual attire like collared shirts, glasses, or hoodies.
