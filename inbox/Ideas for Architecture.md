## 1. Patterns Exist Across Frameworks

 - **Niche vs. General:** BMAD is optimized for Agile cycles (PRDs to code); Agent OS is built for environment interaction.
    
- **The Complexity Trade-off:** High-abstraction frameworks make simple tasks easy but complex customizations nearly impossible.

## 2. The Specialization Trap

- **Niche vs. General:** BMAD is optimized for Agile cycles (PRDs to code); Agent OS is built for environment interaction.
    
- **The Complexity Trade-off:** High-abstraction frameworks make simple tasks easy but complex customizations nearly impossible.

## 3. FW System Expert and/or Orchestrator

- **State Management:** The orchestrator's role in maintaining the "source of truth" across multiple agent turns.
    
- **The "Architect" Pattern:** Using a high-level model to gatekeep and validate the work of agents.

## 4. Natural language vs. Code

- **The Dual Pipeline:** How we use English to describe the "What" and Python/TypeScript to enforce the "How."
    
- **Prompt Engineering as Logic:** Treating system prompts as the "new assembly language" for agent behavior.

## 5. Learning Loops for Adaptability with Iteration

- **Reflection Patterns:** Agents reviewing their own logs or error messages to self-correct before presenting a result.
    
- **Memory and Directives Architecture:** The distinction between short-term context and long-term knowledge.

## 6. Context Management for All

- **Context Management Is Key:** While each framework approaches this differently, they all share a common goal, ensuring the model has exactly what it needs to act, without the noise.
	
- **Operation Awareness:** Different systems have different "appetites" for this data, and mastering how to provide it is the difference between a coherent output and a hallucination.

## 7. The Builder Mindset 

- **Framework as Scaffolding:** Don't get attached to a specific framework or tool. Think of these frameworks as a set of patterns that can be used as modules for your systems.
	
- **Mastery through Construction:** The best way to learn how the system works is to build it from the ground up.
