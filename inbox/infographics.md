# Infographic Ideas - Ideas for Architecture (Consolidated)

I've merged the 9 original architectural points into 6 high-impact infographics that focus on explaining concepts and processes for your video.

**Style Guide:** All images follow the [Art Skill Aesthetic](file:///Users/rodrigocanoteran/Projects/pal-personal/.claude/skills/art/Aesthetic.md) (Excalidraw style, white background, black outlines, purple `#7450db` spot color).

## 1. The Gateway: Why a Framework? (Mental Model)

**Concepts:** Context as the Foundation vs. Prompting as a band-aid.
**Visual:** A person crossing a bridge toward a building with a massive purple foundation labeled 'CONTEXT'. A flimsy post-it note labeled 'PROMPT' blows away.
**Process:** Transition from Autopilot (asking favors) to Architect (managing systems).
**Prompt:** `Minimalist Excalidraw-style illustration: a human with a laptop crossing a suspension bridge toward a sturdy building with a glowing purple foundation labeled 'CONTEXT'. A small post-it note labeled 'PROMPT' is blowing away in the wind. Stark white background, clean black outlines, purple spot color only on the foundation and bridge planks.`

## 2. The Orchestrator: Master Logic (Process)

**Concepts:** Intent Classification + Routing.
**Visual:** Purple mascot (PromptPal) at a central switchboard, directing data streams from a 'USER' input into specific 'SKILL' and 'AGENT' channels.
**Process:** How the system decides where to send a request.
**Prompt:** `Excalidraw drawing of PromptPal mascot at a central technology podium, directing several flowing data lines into different labeled folders. Transparent icons for 'Intent' and 'Routing' are displayed. Purple mascot, black outlines, minimalist vector art, white background.`

## 3. Modular Capabilities: Skills & Workflows (Structure)

**Concepts:** Skill Containers + Repeatable Workflows.
**Visual:** A cubic 'Skill Block' with a transparent side showing a multi-step (1-2-3) workflow path inside it.
**Process:** Capabilities are modular; workflows are the logic within them.
**Prompt:** `Hand-drawn technical illustration of a modular 'Skill' cube. A semi-transparent side shows a linear flowchart path (1 -> 2 -> 3) inside the cube. The cube's frame and the flowchart arrows are purple. Clean lines, minimalist, stipple shading for depth.`

## 4. The Specialist: Agent & Domain Logic (Context)

**Concepts:** Specialized Persona + Domain Source of Truth.
**Visual:** A PromptPal wearing a specialized headset (Art/Code Agent), holding a glowing purple book labeled 'DOMAIN INDEX'.
**Process:** How agents focus on a specific project's "Source of Truth."
**Prompt:** `Hand-drawn illustration of a specialized PromptPal mascot wearing a toolbelt and technical headset, looking at a large open book labeled 'INDEX.md' that glows with purple light. Clean lines, minimalist, purple used for the mascot and the book's glow.`

## 5. Security & Safety: Hooks & Guardrails (Process)

**Concepts:** Interception + Validation.
**Visual:** A tool (wrench) attempting an action on a file, but being intercepted by a purple ring labeled 'PRE-TOOL HOOK' and a checklist for 'GUARDRAILS'.
**Process:** The safety layer that validates every action before it happens.
**Prompt:** `Technical illustration of a floating wrench tool being stopped by a circular perimeter ring labeled 'HOOK / GUARDRAIL'. A small checkmark list is visible next to the ring. The tool and ring are vibrant purple. Excalidraw style, white background, black outlines.`

## 6. The Logic Layer: Tools vs. Hallucinations (Logic)

**Concepts:** Deterministic Tools vs. Model Logic.
**Visual:** A brain (Model) connected to a solid, precise machine (Tool). The connection and the machine are purple.
**Process:** Eliminating hallucinations by offloading complex operations to CLI utilities.
**Prompt:** `Minimalist illustration of a hand-drawn brain silhouette connected by a purple cable to a precise technical gear machine. The machine is labeled 'DETERMINISTIC TOOL'. Clean black lines, stark white background, purple spot color on the cable and the gear tool.`
