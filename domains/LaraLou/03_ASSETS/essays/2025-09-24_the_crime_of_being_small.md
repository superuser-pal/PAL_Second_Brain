# The Crime of Being Small

> On the spider in the corner of your room, the inconveniences that ask for grace, and the small mercies we can give and can only hope to receive

I imagine being a spider. To wake inside the tremble of my own threads, a house made of spit and silk. My body poured out in strings of silver, weaving a geometry fragile enough that a breath could undo it. To carry the strangeness of so many eyes, seeing the room multiplied through a dozen dark mirrors, kaleidoscopic. I carry a body smaller than a coin, and yet watch giants recoil at the sight of me. Always, I return to the same truth: I am delicate, yet I am feared.

I am deadly afraid of spiders. I keep trying to trace the fear back to its first thread. It started, funny enough, in a grocery store. I was small, standing beside my mother when I noticed the woman in front of us. She had a cropped head of curls, dense and springy, a forest of loops. And then, whether real or imagined, I still don’t know, I saw a spider moving inside them, as if her hair had sprouted legs of its own. I tugged at my mother’s sleeve, tried to point, but she pressed my hand down. She probably told me it was rude to stare and point. By the time I saw the woman again, at the cashier’s line, the spider had vanished.

Years later, I can still think of few things that would terrify me more than finding a spider in my hair. I must have been afraid already, but this was different. The horror wasn’t that it might crawl across the floor or dangle in front of my face. The horror was that it could disappear into me, slip into the folds of my hair, vanish where no one else could see, and live there unnoticed. That was the part that lodged itself deepest: not the sight of the spider, but the not-seeing of it anymore.

I wonder sometimes how much of this fear is even mine, and how much I’ve simply borrowed. Haven’t I been taught to fear spiders? Films, stories, the sudden shriek from a kitchen when one scuttles across the floor, all of it passing the lesson along. But to what end? If I lived in Australia, where spiders can kill, perhaps the fear would serve a purpose. Here in the Netherlands, the worst they can do is startle you. No venom. No danger. Just eight legs in the wrong place.

It’s strange, the way we shudder at small things. How a body no larger than a coin can send a grown person running from the room. There’s something almost unfair about it, that the smaller the creature, the more monstrous we make it. A spider in the corner, a moth against the light, a beetle clicking across the floor: each becomes a trespasser in our perfect human space, guilty of nothing more than existing within it.

A spider weaves in the corner of my room. A moth throws itself at the bulb, frantic for the false sun. A beetle drags its armored body across the floor. Once, I would have screamed. Now I just nod. I remind myself: they are not the strangers. They are only doing what they have always done; weaving, seeking light, tracing the ground beneath them. The white box I call a room is the stranger.

The first time I started thinking differently about spiders was because of a tweet. Someone wrote about dreaming a poem from the perspective of a bug to God, and the only part they remembered was the last line: I pray nobody kills me for the crime of being small. For some reason it made me cry, maybe I was on my period, who knows. But it stayed with me. I kept thinking how ridiculously easy it would be to show a little mercy, even when something scares me. Especially if it’s that harmless.

After that, I couldn’t bring myself to kill them anymore. I made a vow with myself: I won’t harm what isn’t here to harm me. I’ll swat a mosquito drinking my blood, sure. But I won’t kill a spider simply for being near. I still hesitate, still flinch, still scream more often than I’d like - my boyfriend, who once watched me tremble and shriek my way through a spider encounter at his place, can attest to that - but I pause. There’s a second thought now, which is a little softer: maybe it doesn’t have to end under a shoe. Maybe fear doesn’t have to mean violence.

Mercy, I keep realizing, is practice. Not a virtue that descends fully formed, but a habit built in the seconds you resist the urge to strike. It begins in the pause: the second thought before the shoe comes down, before the sharp words leave your mouth, before you harden yourself against someone’s clumsiness. Mercy is muscle. To practice it is to resist the reflex that fear teaches us; to lash out, to protect ourselves by destroying what unnerves us.

And I can’t help but notice how much of the world runs on that reflex. Violence seems to hum underneath everything lately. Whole cities swallowed by bombs. Politicians gorging themselves on outrage. Arguments from the far edges blown up until they look like society’s center. And yet in my own life, it’s quieter than that. Most people I meet are just trying to get through the day.

Hannah Arendt once wrote that “the smallest act in the most limited circumstances bears the seed of boundlessness.” I think about that often, how even the tiniest gestures can tilt something in us. So I practice in small, sometimes clumsy ways: letting the spider live to see another day. Not because it will fix the world, but because it changes how I move through it.

Sometimes I don’t even think of it as mercy. More like calibration. Each time I pause, for a spider, for a stranger or even just for myself, it tilts me a little closer to the person I hope to be. Someone less ruled by reflex, less at war with the small things.

My best friend once told me about the spider she named Harry, who lived in the corner of her bathroom for weeks. They coexisted peacefully until the day she found him perched on her toothbrush. That was the end of Harry. I’m no moral authority, but I think mercy isn’t meant to be endless. It falters, it bends. What matters, at least to me, is that we try.

I think back to that tweet, the one about a dream: a bug commissioned to write a poem to God, all of it forgotten except for the final line. It felt unfinished, that dream turned fragment, as if it was asking to be continued. I’ll let the spider speak.
