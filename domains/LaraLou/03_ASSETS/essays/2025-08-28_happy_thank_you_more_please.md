# Happy. Thank You. More Please

> On gratitude, a dear friend who is no longer here, a salt-stung afternoon on a boat in Italy

The boat rocks gently, the sea whooshing against its sides. Salt has dried on my skin in small crystals, glittering when I move. The sea is as blue as I had hoped. I close my eyes against the sunlight. I try really hard to hold the moment still. ‘I’m grateful, ’ I think, ‘I’m grateful for this life. ’

When I was younger, gratitude always felt like a performance of sorts. Something adults wanted from you: ‘Say thank you.’ ‘Be polite,’ or as my parents used to say, ‘think about the poor kids from Africa,’ as if hunger somewhere else should make me want to swallow whatever was on my plate. Gratitude wasn’t noticing what you had; it was swallowing what you didn’t want. It was always tied to comparison, to someone else’s suffering.

When I was a teenager, gratitude felt like an excuse. A way of waving off responsibility. What was even the point of being grateful, acknowledging how good you have it, if you are just going to ignore the suffering in the world? Even my parents’ words made me feel restless. What about those poor kids in Africa? I remember thinking: If we know how bad they have it, how hungry they are, why are we just thinking about them? Why are we using their hunger to keep whiny children quiet at the dinner table?

Somewhere along the way, I decided to do something good. I was going to give back. Express my gratitude that way. I saved up for years and booked a one-way ticket to Ghana to work in an orphanage in the northernmost part of the country. I remember picking that one specifically because it was the most remote and desolate. It was perfect for my self-imposed penance, with humble gratitude banishing myself to a remote corner of the earth. Gratitude sharpened into sacrifice.

Looking back now, it was arrogance disguised as goodness. I was so young and so certain. I had absolutely nothing to offer except my own need to believe that I was helping. No training, no experience whatsoever in either childcare or teaching, and no language. Just a white girl with the conviction that her presence was somehow a gift. Something that would pay for my own restless feeling of inequality.

The orphanage itself was more ruin and less anything a child could grow inside of. Two open rooms with three filthy mattresses each. The mosquito nets just ornamental since there were holes in them the size of my fists. I soon realized how arrogant I had been. Not even a week in, and I felt like the only thing I was doing was being a tourist in someone else’s poverty. Cosplaying as one of them while, in actuality, I, a teenage girl, was probably one of the wealthiest people they ever met. I started to feel the weight of my own uselessness. Like I had come all this way just to look at their lives up close, and leave them unchanged.

Still, there were people there holding it together, not with foreign good intentions but with their lives. That’s how I met Issifu. He was the host-father of the family I was staying with, and he ran the orphanage. He was a gentle, soft-spoken man. Eager to connect, even more eager to listen. He had a steadiness about him that was calming.

When I met Issifu, he had just been in a bad motorcycle accident. He had broken an arm and a leg, his bones held in place with metal plates. Without antibiotics, his body began to expel them, forcing the steel back through his skin. He was in constant pain; he must have been, because the plates started protruding out of his skin. His open wounds began to fester. Yet, looking at him, all I could see was peace. Fueled by my white saviour complex, a fight with the local medicine man, and the fact that I sometimes had access to the internet, I started cleaning his wounds thrice a day and changing the bandages. This is when we would talk.

Deeply religious, he had learned how to detach himself from hardships. “God knows best,” he would say, or “It’s all his plan.” I, who back then had a deeply hostile attitude towards anything religious, admired him for it. He expressed love so freely, without shame. He cherished being a teacher. He revered his sons and daughters. He absolutely adored his wife, Ama. He loved meeting new people. He had this funny way of praying. Instead of asking for what he wanted, he would instead list all the things he was grateful for, and he would end, not with amen, but with “thank you, more please.”

I asked him about it. I asked him, “Why do you pray like that?” He told me, simply: “I am happy, I am thankful, and so I ask God for more.” It has become quite the thing for me. Whenever I am overcome with a need or something I desperately want. I think about what Issifu told me all those years ago. I think about all the things in my life that I am grateful for. I list them one by one, say thank you, and ask for more.

Issifu died last year in December from complications of diabetes. I always knew he wasn’t going to grow old, but it still came as a shock. Since 2013, when I first visited Ghana, we have maintained contact through WhatsApp. Every other week, we would check in. He would often send me glittery GIFs, saying something like ‘Good day ahead,’ completely serious. I loved it. I miss him. It feels unfair that he had to leave this place so soon. He gave me so much more than I could ever have hoped to give him.

The way he prays loops in my mind like a song that’s stuck on repeat. I hear his voice saying the words to me in odd places; sometimes it rises in the aisles of the supermarket, other times when I see something beautiful that begs to be felt. It’s not a comfort exactly. More an instruction that I fail at, more often than not. A reminder that gratitude isn’t about deserving but about noticing.

I don’t always manage. The words are there, but sometimes they feel false in my mouth. I still have a complicated relationship with gratitude; it somehow always feels like a performance, even when I say it silently in my mind, even when no one is there to witness me. Sometimes, though, moments demand notice. And every time, I think of Issifu. The way he always ended, as if asking was the most natural extension of gratitude itself: more, please.

Today, I am on a boat. I’m lying in the sun. The boat is filled with people I adore. My skin is salted with tiny crystals, so when I move, they glitter and reflect the sunlight. The sea hushes and the boat rocks. I feel drowsy with sleep. Next to me is the man I love. He’s holding my hand. There are still a few days left before I return home. I am happy. I am grateful. I want more, exactly like this.
