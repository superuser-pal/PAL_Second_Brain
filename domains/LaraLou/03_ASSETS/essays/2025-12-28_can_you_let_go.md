# Can You Let Go?

> On holding on, release, and the myth of decisive endings

Rip it from my white-knuckle grip. Don’t be gentle, I won’t be either. Pry my fingers open one by one until the muscles are screaming. Take what I’m clinging to and tear it from me. Let it hurt. Let the skin break. Because that is the only reason it will be released; with violence. If letting go is going to happen, it won’t arrive as mercy. It will come like dislocation. Let there be no doubt: I will not let this go willingly.

I have always had this habit of keeping things pressed into my palm long after they’ve started cutting into the skin. Not things you can point to, or things you can actually hold, but moments, versions, expectations. I stay longer than comfort allows. Longer than sense would recommend. By the time it becomes painful, the holding on has already shaped itself around me.

David Foster Wallace once wrote, “Everything I’ve ever let go of has claw marks on it.” I used to find comfort in that line. I used to identify with it. Sometimes, I still do. I’ve told friends to let things go more times than I can count. I’ve heard the same advice handed back to me just as often. And my answer has always been the same. I can’t. I’m trying, but I can’t.

It’s not like I’ve never tried of course. If anything, I have reasoned with myself. Bargained. Waited for time to loosen the grip on my behalf. I have dressed many moments up as readiness. None of it has worked. My hands stayed locked. My body refusing the instruction. So when I’ve been told to release, to trust the process, I have only braced myself and held on even tighter. Thinking, if this is going to leave me, it will have to be taken. I will feel the tearing. I will hear the joint slip. I will know the exact moment it goes.

The other day, my boyfriend told me that he too has never let anything go willingly, but when the time came, he realised he just wasn’t holding it anymore. He didn’t let it go so much as it left him. I feel like this is the way it goes for everyone. So why do we keep telling each other to let things go? And why does knowing something is over rarely stop the mind from going back for it?

You can realise something no longer serves you and still keep circling it because the brain is slow to unlearn what it once found useful. When something mattered, when it brought relief or pleasure or a sense of meaning, the brain marked it as relevant. That marking doesn’t disappear just because circumstances change. Even after the reward is gone, the mind keeps returning, checking, revisiting, as if it might still be there. It’s the same reason you keep reaching for a light switch in a room where the lamp has already been removed. The brain learned a pattern, and it keeps running it until there’s enough evidence that it no longer works.

Wanting to let go doesn’t interrupt that process. In fact, it often keeps it running. Every time you think about something, even with the intention of releasing it, you’re reinforcing its presence. The brain doesn’t distinguish very well between wanting, resisting, regretting, or hoping; all of those still count as engagement. What actually changes things is repetition without payoff. Time passing without the expected outcome. Days where nothing happens slowly weakens the signal. The thought comes back less urgently, then less often, then one day it doesn’t come back at all. Not because you finally did something right, but because the brain stopped expecting anything to be there.

What makes this so exhausting isn’t just the holding on, but the belief that we should be done by now. That there is a correct timeline for attachment, and that missing it means something about our character. We start watching ourselves too closely. We start counting the days. Measuring progress by the absence of thought or emotion. And when the thought returns, because it always does, we take it as proof of failure. As if staying attached is a moral flaw rather than a nervous system doing exactly what it was built to do.

I’ve started to think we overestimate how much say we have in letting go. I can understand something completely and still feel unchanged by it. A tree doesn’t release its fruit until it’s ripe. When the fruit falls, it isn’t an act of will. It’s gravity doing its work after time has done its share. When the fruit falls, it’s not the tree letting go of it so much as fruit falling on its own. It needed the time to ripen on the tree before it could make its way to the ground.

I think about all the things I once swore would have to be torn from me. Things that I once braced my body for while digging my nails in as deep as I could. Things I already rehearsed the pain of. And I can’t remember the moment they went. Only that one day, my hands were empty.

The mistake is thinking of letting go as something decisive. We imagine it as an act of courage. A clean choice. A final gesture we can point to and be proud of. But most endings don’t arrive like that. They don’t announce themselves. They happen quietly enough that you only notice them afterward. Letting go, then, is rarely something you do. It’s something you recognize in hindsight.

I’m writing this one just after Christmas. That small window between Christmas and New Years has always felt like a good time to take stock of the year, to decide what to take with you into the new year, and what to leave behind. This year, join me in doing this with a little kindness to yourself. Some things are just not ready to be let go of yet, but you will have to trust that, when the time comes, it will ripen, and you will be rid of it. All you can do in the meantime is hold it with a little more love. To unclench, even if its just a little.

So, loosen your white-knuckle grip; no one is coming to tear it from your hands. If you’re going to be holding it anyway, let it be held gently for the last while. There’s no need for hurt, or for the breaking of skin. Let it rest in your palm without digging in, without bracing for the moment it leaves. On a day you might not even suspect, it will be gone. Your hands will be empty.
