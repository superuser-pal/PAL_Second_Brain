# Death Becomes Her

> On the strange companionship that follows an almost-ending

Death loosened his cold fingers and raised his hand. A gesture, not a threat. A wave, really. He waved once, then again. And with each wave, he came closer and closer. At one point, the space between us thinned and Death unfurled its grave-dust-speckled finger and reached for mine. We could have touched; a dark mirror of God and Adam, creation running backward. And maybe we did. Not a full touch, just a brush of the fingers, only for the briefest of seconds. I could just imagine being swallowed up by the darkness. An unceremonious end to a short life.

There’s something strange about knowing you once lived without fear, before you knew the word “die” or before you understood what that meant. Back then, I didn’t yet know that Death can stand in the doorway long before you learn to see him. Back when I still believed that good intentions were enough to keep you safe. That wanting to do something kind was the same as doing something good. So, at eighteen I decided I should go to Ghana to “help people.” It was my naive, self-congratulatory way of giving back, and it nearly killed me.

Ghana was mesmerizingly beautiful. Red-earthed and dust-veiled, it felt like another planet entirely. Armed with a wide smile, a misplaced sense of mission and about a dozen shots against all kinds of tropical diseases I thought had long been eradicated, I made my way to the northernmost part of the country, to, maybe you’ve guessed it by now… volunteer in an orphanage.

It didn’t take long for me to get the sense that my good intentions weren’t helping anyone there. Those sweet children, most of whom were not actual orphans, just abandoned by their families, started asking me soon after my arrival when I would leave. Their short lives so far had just been a procession of people they grew attached to eventually leaving again. I tried to make the best of my time there, be as useful as I could, but my entire time there was tinged with guilt.

Still, I grew close to the people there. To Issifu, who taught me many many things and who I miss dearly now that he is no longer alive. To Ama, who spent days and days making peanut butter to sell on the market and laughed at my attempts to carry buckets of water on my head. To Ephraim and David, who sometimes slipped their hands into mine as we walked and wanted to hear all about my life back in the Netherlands. I remember being happy. Being content.

After a few months there, when the homesickness had long come in and settled, I got sick from eating chicken in Bolgatanga. At first I thought it was a stomach bug, but I soon realized, as I couldn’t hold anything down at all, that it was more serious than that. It turned out to be typhoid. Not the kind I was vaccinated against, but easy enough to solve. After half a day waiting in a hospital, I left with medicine that got me back to normal in 3 days. What I had not realised, was that during those days, my malaria pills had not been in my stomach long enough to work.

About two weeks later, I started feeling funny. The thick Ghanian air started to feel heavier than before. I lost my appetite first, I think. Food stopped tasting like anything, and the thought of eating made my stomach turn. Then came the headaches. They made my head pulse like my heartbeat. By the third day of not eating I finally took my temperature. I had a fever, which was enough reason to go to the hospital. The hospital in Wulugu was a low concrete building with open windows and plastic chairs lined against the wall. I remember a procession of chickens coming down the halls. If I had paid closer attention, I might have seen Death then, leaning against the doorframe of that hospital corridor, patiently waiting.

The doctors there told me it was malaria and gave me a shot. Later I learned it wasn’t real medication, they were saving the actual antimalarials for their own people. I can’t blame them for that. Still, I went back to the compound believing I’d been treated. Another day later, my skin was burning with fever, my veins thick with hot blood, something I had never felt before. I remember thinking that it felt like ants crawling up and down my arms and legs, underneath my skin. All those tiny little legs leaving a trail of an uncanny tingle. The air was syrup, the ceiling moved, and Death started showing me its face. Watching as I fought with my body to keep down tiny sips of water. Once I started seeing actual ants moving under my skin, I knew I had to get to an actual hospital in the capital of Ghana.

There was a bus leaving in a few hours which would go all the way to the capital; seventeen hours on cracked roads. My flip phone was dead; the power had been out all day. I didn’t have time to find an ATM, so I got on with barely any money, half-conscious and already shaking. I could feel my body starting to shut itself down. Death was in the seat next to me, watching as I fought and failed to keep down the little that was left in my stomach.

Dying did not feel like I thought it would. I had imagined terror, the reel of memories, the famous flash of light. In my case, there was no fear, only a desperate, animalistic need to keep going. I don’t think I have ever experienced more focus than right then. Even while I was continually passing out, I didn’t see my life, or my family, or some divine light. There was only a voice, my own, very loud, telling me: keep your eyes open.

After hours that I can only describe as the worst of my life, I made it down south. I got off the bus, threw myself in a cab and showed the driver the address that I had written down on a piece of paper. I knew that if I opened my mouth to speak, I would vomit. Once in the hospital, I was immediately admitted. I was severely dehydrated at that point, and delirious. To keep me calm, they loaded my IV with oxazepam. Through drowsy eyes, I could still see Death, standing in the doorframe. The doctors told me that if I had come a few hours later, I would not have been alive anymore.

I wish my brush with death could be one of those inspirational stories where the main character gains this infectious zest for life. The feel-good montage that follows; a person, not beaten down by trauma but uplifted: a new outlook on life. But this isn’t one of those stories. Death didn’t leave when he should have. He stepped back, but stayed close enough that I could still feel him watching me. Long after I was out of danger, I believed that I was going to die. When that feeling finally left me, I found myself wishing that I had.

I cannot tell you how I spent my hours in the hospital. Years of trauma therapy have made those memories feel like they don’t belong to me. I remember being afraid the doctors weren’t using clean needles. I remember telling the nurses to stop giving me oxazepam because it made me drowsy and I needed to stay awake. I remember a woman in the bed next to me, crying for hours. When the crying stopped, I looked over and saw Death standing beside her bed, his hand resting on her shoulder. When I finally escaped my hospital room, she had passed away.

I can’t explain what was going through my mind in those final hours in Ghana, only that I knew I couldn’t stay. The thought of dying there, in that room, like that woman had, felt unbearable. And somehow, in those delirious hours, I had become convinced that this would only end in death. I called my mom. I lied about what happened and I asked her to book a plane ticket for the next day.

I remember getting off of the plane, wondering if I was dreaming. Sleepwalking maybe. The thing I had thought about obsessively for those past 72 hours had somehow been made into a reality. I was home. I was going to see the people I loved. I was not going to die in the bus to Accra, or on the side of the road waiting for a taxi to take me to the hospital, or in the hospital where the woman next to me was slowly disintegrating, or at the hostel in the shower when I had to sit down because I was too tired to stand up, or waiting in the airport hall for the plane to be able to leave the storm soaked skies of Ghana, or in those 7 hours in the sky.

I hadn’t died. I wasn’t dying anymore. Yet, somehow, Death had come back home with me. I couldn’t forget its face. He started sleeping in my bed. So I asked my sweet mother to sleep with me. I didn’t want to die alone, you see. He followed me when I would bike home late at night, turning up the brightness of the street lamps, blurring my vision. I had my eyes tested, convinced that my blurry new view of the world was just my eyes going bad. Death lived in my lungs and convinced me that I did not get enough oxygen.

My body had become an unreliable narrator, replaying chapters I had already lived through. Rearranging time as if suddenly choosing a new narrative device. Like Vonnegut’s Billy Pilgrim, I had become unstuck in time. Death became like a ghost, not fully present, not fully gone, but always capable of stepping into the room. As the years passed though, he visited less and less. And in 2018, when I traveled to Ghana again - mostly to look unblinkingly into the face of the thing I feared the most, to take that fear and transform it into something else, something beautiful - Death did an almost full retreat, and I had to say goodbye to my companion.

Sometimes I still see him. Sometimes I will still find him lying in my bed. I tell him, gently, that he is unwelcome. Some days Death will wave at me, from a long distance, and I will wave back to him, as if greeting an old friend. Other days, he finds me unguarded. I’ll see him in the numbers on a thermometer, or feel him in the innocent tickle in my throat, and for a moment, it will feel as if he is once more grazing his cold fingers past mine. I have to remind myself that he is only ever a feeling and that he and I will never actually meet. If he’s there, I will not be. As long as I am here, he won’t be and I am safe.
