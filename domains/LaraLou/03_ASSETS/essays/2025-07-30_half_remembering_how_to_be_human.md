# Half Remembering How to Be Human

> Writing my way back to the parts I've neglected; attention, wonder, stillness, and the quiet space where I used to feel most like myself

When I was a kid, my grandmother used to take me on trips all over the country. She was one of the worst drivers I’ve ever known. Her tiny car smelled like menthol and cigarettes, and every time she pulled away from a stop, there was this strange lag, like the engine had to gather itself. The car would dip back slightly, hesitate, and then lurch forward in uneven bursts, comically fast for the bird-boned woman behind the wheel.

When she got older, she stopped taking her car places. Driving started to scare her. Which was kind of funny, because when she was still driving, her driving should have already scared her. So, during my teenage years, we took to the train instead.

I remember those train rides well. Not because they were exciting, but because they were boring. My grandmother used to say that only boring people get bored. So I would stare out the window and just watch things. Empty fields. A rusted trampoline. A tree that always looked like it was waving.

I remember the way time felt then. A train ride would stretch out. A school day carried the weight of a week. And a summer was long enough to reinvent yourself before school started again. I didn’t think about time as something that could slip through my fingers. I hadn’t learned to fear its passing yet. Back then, time didn’t need managing; it just filled the space you gave it. And boredom was part of that. It wasn’t something to solve. It was just there.

In a way, boredom gave me endless space to think, or dream, or just exist. I wasn’t trying to capture anything. I was just living the moments as they came, then letting them go. The more I think about those train rides, the more I realize that I’m not just remembering boredom. I’m remembering a version of myself I barely recognize now. A self that wasn’t always performing, reacting, optimizing. I didn’t carry a tiny rectangle full of other people’s lives in my pocket. I wasn’t constantly being reminded of how I could be funnier, fitter, more productive, more beautiful.

I’ve become a stranger to my own stillness.

There’s a particular kind of boredom that used to feel fertile. The kind that let your mind wander without direction or outcome. That boredom was a gateway to noticing. To thoughts you didn’t plan. To the quiet, slightly strange ideas that only show up when nothing else is happening. But boredom today feels sterile. Rushed. Almost shameful. The moment it arrives, we swat it away with noise.

The other day, my phone died during an hour-long train ride. Just an hour. But that hour felt like solitary confinement. A mental Alcatraz. Nothing to distract me from the pressing weight of thoughts I had been pushing to the back of my mind. I was left with just me, a window, and a mind I hadn’t been alone with in a while. I caught myself reaching for my phone several times, like a phantom limb still expecting to be there.

We don’t really do boredom anymore. Not the kind that stretches or opens or leads somewhere. Boredom now is a kind of failure. A sign that you're wasting time. An ad slot left unfilled. You could have been productive. You could have learned something. You could have watched a man and his mistress at a Coldplay concert, a girl rate the newest viral plumping lipgloss, and AI bunnies jumping a trampoline, all in under thirty seconds.

Somewhere during my mental spiral, I started thinking about the many hours I’ve spent trapped in the internet loop. Eyes glazed, thumb twitching, brain half-dissolving. At some point, probably during the peak of the Italian brainrot era, I realized I knew way too much about TikTok discourse I wasn’t even part of. The fact that I, a thirty-year-old woman, know what Italian brainrot is already says enough.

I wish I could say that was the moment something changed. That I threw my phone into a river and started meditating at dawn. But I didn’t. I still scroll. Caught between the person I am and the one I half-remember being. Someone who could sit with herself a little longer. Someone who didn’t flinch at her own mind. I think that’s what I miss most. Not just my attention span, but the parts of myself that used to live inside it. The quiet, noticing self. The one that made little drawings in the margins of homework and carried a notebook around, just in case something worth writing down would reveal itself.

I want to learn how to not fear my thoughts, and maybe the first step is just writing them down. To hopefully get a little closer, not to who I used to be necessarily, not to some golden, tax and laundry-free past I’m probably misremembering, but to a feeling. The feeling of noticing things again.

To remember how to linger. I’ve always liked that verb. It doesn’t translate well into Dutch. Translated, it just means to be stuck on something. But to me, lingering is softer than being stuck. It’s choosing to stay a moment longer, even when there’s no reason to. It’s attention without urgency. And maybe that’s all writing is: a way to linger. So here I am, returning to something I’ve loved since I was a kid: writing.

I’ll be posting weekly essays on the questions that pull at me; about time, identity, attention, meaning, and what it takes to live with any real sense of intention. Some pieces will be personal, some more idea-driven, but all of them are part of the same project: trying to hold onto what actually matters. If any of that speaks to you, or if you’ve also half-forgotten how to be human, you’re welcome to read along.

Today is my grandmother’s birthday. I hadn’t planned to write anything, or remember much at all. But I keep thinking about those long train rides we used to take. How the world passed by in pieces. Slow, strange, and quietly beautiful. Back then, wonder didn’t need chasing. It just showed up, like light through a window.

She used to say that boredom was for boring people. Back then it just made me feel bad for feeling bored. Now, I think back on those slow train rides and wonder if that was the point all along. Not to avoid boredom, but to pass through it. And that if you sit with it long enough, the mind starts to quiet. Ideas come floating up. A thought. A memory of a person you love. Maybe even a niche for a Substack.

I think my grandmother was onto something.
