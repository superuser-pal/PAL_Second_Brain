# Here I Am

> On the certainty of being forgotten, the marks we leave behind, and the gift of the present

There’s something I always do in hotel rooms. If there’s a painting above the bed, I’ll lift it just enough to slip a pen behind the frame and write on the back. Nothing elaborate: just a name, a date, sometimes a cryptic line that makes me laugh to imagine someone discovering it years later. A mark no one is meant to see right away, but still waiting, quietly, for the moment it’s found. It’s my small ritual, a way of saying: I am here.

I’ve done it other places too. A piece of ripped shorts stuffed into the cracks of an eighteenth-century ruin. Locks on bridges. Once I even buried a small time capsule in the yard of the first home I lived in, by a bench on a bed of soft clovers. Think: tin can filled with a plastic dinosaur, a couple of marbles and a little note. Secret marks in secret places, left to be swallowed by weather, by time, or by human hands. Still, I like to imagine a stranger coming across that scrap of fabric in the stones and knowing that once, on an ordinary afternoon, somebody passed through and wanted to be remembered. I am here.

Every time I do it, I think of cave paintings. Not the ones of animals, though those are beautiful. The ones with the handprints. Thousands of years old, pigment blown around a palm pressed against the wall; the oldest graffiti we know. A person long gone, saying the only thing they could: I am here.

I can’t help but find it cute: our names carved into bridges, scribbled on abandoned walls, scratched into desks in classrooms long since emptied. We all carry this need to leave something behind. I was here. I was here. I was here. The oldest human refrain. It’s sweet to me, this instinct to be witnessed by strangers we’ll never meet. We have always asked the future for this small favor. Please remember that I stood in this exact spot and breathed. I am here.

Maybe this instinct comes from this horrible knowledge that perhaps we human animals are cursed with: the knowledge that one day, we won’t be here. We know our bodies are only temporary, that our names will thin out like smoke. And so we press ourselves into stone, into wood, into digital dust, as if to say: remember me past my own remembering. I am here.

I used to be afraid of disappearing. I remember asking my mother what it meant to die. She said something like: people who die never truly leave us. I was a curious kid; I wasn’t satisfied. I wanted to know when dead meant fully dead. She told me, my sweet mother, that people aren’t really gone until the last person stops remembering them.

As an adult, I can see the beauty in this. Maybe the apple does not fall far from the tree and my mom is a secret poet. As a child, though, the thought shook me. This idea that one day there would be a final person with a final thought, and then nothing. That even memory dies. It terrified me, this idea that I would vanish twice: once in body, once in thought.

For a long time I carried that fear like a stone in my pocket. I thought about it very seriously and realized I never think about my great-grandmother. Three generations; that’s all it would take for me to disappear. So, I wanted to leave a mark somehow. Maybe that’s why I started writing. I remember being a teenager and wanting to write something lasting or to make art that would outlive me.

It’s silly, because even with the fear of not leaving a mark, I also feared leaving the wrong one. I held myself back, convinced I hadn’t earned the right to begin. Not enough books read yet to write. Not enough drawings made to start painting. Too young, then suddenly already too old. I lived in the waiting room of my own life, rehearsing and rehearsing and putting off the actual performance.

What freed me, strangely, was realizing my mother’s words could mean something else. For years I thought I needed to leave the perfect mark so I wouldn’t disappear. But if nothing lasts, then the point isn’t being remembered, it’s being present. Leaving a mark still matters, but now it’s less about the future and more about pressing my hand into the wet cement of the present. And without forever hanging over it, perfection doesn’t matter anymore.

If nothing lasts, then maybe the weight of achievement was never real. You don’t have to build a monument; you just stack stones into the shape of a day. Write the thing you want to write. Say the love, even if sometimes, it makes you feel like an idiot. Create the thing, even if it’s not perfect, even if it’s not very good. Hold a hand for no other reason except that it’s there to hold. It won’t last, but while it burns, it’s yours.

At night, I sometimes think about what will be left when I die. Maybe these words will sit in a server farm until a power outage wipes them out. Maybe the internet will fold into some other thing and all these little essays will become pixel-soaked static. If I were sensible about permanence, I would start carving stone. Epic of Gilgamesh style: chisel and stone tablet and a sore back. But even stone forgets, only slower.

Maybe it’s foolish, but I still want a book that sits on a shelf and outlives me. I am not finished with ambition. I don’t think I will ever be. Ambition feels a little lighter now though, less a debt to the future and more a gift to the present. Because besides leaving my mark, I want to write because writing is how I pay attention. I want to create things because otherwise the days blur, and I need something solid to hold in my hands. To not only prove to the future: I was here, but to also remind myself that I will only ever be alive in this moment. Right now.

And I can keep the oldest human ritual without pretending it will last. I can still write my name on the backs of hotel paintings. I can still tuck fabric into stone, or scratch me and my boyfriend’s initials on a wall somewhere. Maybe, I should make another time capsule of all my favorite things, and bury it beneath a lovely patch of clovers. Not because it will survive, but because I want to honor the urge to leave something of myself behind. Because doing these things lets me feel the truth of it now. I am here.

We are all here for a time, and then we leave. My mother taught me that this won’t be the end yet. After we leave, we still live on in the memories of others, and if you create something, perhaps people will think of you a little longer. I know that I will do my best to keep the people I love alive for as long as I can after they die. When my mom dies, may it be far, far from now, I will think of her, and tell my grandchildren about her. Because she taught me, years ago, that this is how she will stay. Come to think of it, maybe I am her way of saying: here I am, I am here.
