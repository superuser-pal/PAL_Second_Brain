# Blessed Are The Addicts

> On the circuitry of desire, dopamine devotion, and impulse

The phone wakes in the dark, casting its small, merciless dawn. You reach for it before you know you’re reaching. The room bends toward the glow, obedient. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. You silence the alarm instead of rising. The light baptises your face. You lie still beneath its blessing, already forgiven. God, grant me the courage to change the things I can. Somewhere in your head the congregation hums what should be a liturgy of want, a gospel of scroll: low, obedient, untranslatable. God, grant me the wisdom to know the difference.

Most mornings begin in the same choreography: I open one eye, find the rectangle, and scroll before I’m even fully awake. I tell myself it’s practical: checking the time or the messages or the news. But within seconds I’ve been pulled into the digital current of everything. There’s a ritual quality to it: the reach, the tap, the glow; a daily mass performed in miniature. It’s an uncanny kind of faith, a belief that the next update might redeem the boredom of the present moment. And when it doesn’t, we keep scrolling anyway, like parishioners who no longer believe in the sermon but stay for the comfort of the pews.

There are smaller gods now: algorithms, caffeine, validation. I pray to all of them without meaning to. Scrolling has become the default posture of modern life. The Homo Scrollus has its neck bent, thumb moving, mind elsewhere. Whole hours form a silent procession and disappear without ceremony. Sometimes I catch myself switching between the same three apps in a loop, as if one of them might have changed while I wasn’t looking. It’s not even fun most of the time; it’s just there. And the worst part is that I can’t remember what I used to do with those scraps of time before the scroll filled them. I could have learned a language by now. Written a book. Or at least folded my laundry. Instead I’ve watched four hundred Battlefield 6 edits.

People like to say we’ve never been more distracted, but that feels too moralizing, too simple. It’s not just distraction; it’s design. The phone has become an ecosystem, a workplace, a stage, a group of friends. I want to stay reachable because that’s how life happens now: invitations, deadlines, intimacy. They all live in the same feed. It’s eerie how connection and exhaustion come from the same place now. I keep thinking I’m choosing connection when really I’m choosing availability. There’s a difference. Connection needs attention. Availability just needs Wi-Fi.

Someone I’m talking to will grab their phone mid-sentence. Not out of malice, just habit. Their face catches the light and they’re gone for a moment, somewhere inside their phone. I keep talking, pretending it’s fine, even though I feel the space where their attention used to be. I’ve done the same thing, probably today. It’s like the body has learned to leave itself, to step sideways into the feed. We see too many lives at once now, hundreds of tiny performances looping on their own stages. The screen builds its own heaven of faces, all smiling, all waiting to be adored. False idols, glowing from the palms of our hands.

I wonder what this is doing to our attention spans. My attention span. How it shapes the way I look at others, and the way I look at myself. Everyone starts to blur a little when you see them through a feed. Faces flatten into patterns: smiles, vacations, opinions, routines. Even my own reflection feels curated; built for viewing. The phone doesn’t just take time; it changes how I notice things, how long I stay with them.

Something I learned during my neuroscience years is that dopamine isn’t the molecule of pleasure but of pursuit. It’s not the reward; it’s the anticipation of the reward. The spike happens not when the thing arrives, but when it might. My brain, it turns out, is a gambler. It bets on maybes. It releases joy at the hint of possibility and disappointment at the sight of certainty. No wonder I keep scrolling, the next thing might be just the thing I’m looking for.

Dopamine was meant to keep us alive, not entertained. It evolved to reward useful things: finding food, solving a problem, falling in love. Now the same circuit runs on thirty-second or less clips. Each one yanks the brain through a new emotion before the last one lands: delight, disgust, sympathy, desire. The chemistry can’t tell which feelings matter, only that something is happening. It rewards the movement itself.

When you repeat that long enough, your baseline shifts. The brain learns to expect the small spike, and anything slower starts to feel uncomfortable. Books feel longer, conversations lag, silence itches, attention becomes something you have to wrestle back. Even satisfaction shrinks. The circuitry adjusts itself around the next hit, and in the process, genuine pleasure becomes harder to locate. Anticipation becomes the altar of worship.

It’s almost ironic how much effort it takes to rest now, and maybe a little sad. Doing nothing used to be a lot easier. Now it requires a plan. Meditation app, noise-canceling headphones, a self-help podcast about reclaiming focus. Even my attempts at peace come with a loading screen. The quiet has to be summoned.

I don’t think the solution is abstinence though. The world lives here now, in pixels. To reject it entirely would be a kind of banishment. And it’s not all bad. The same screen that distracts me also connects me to you, my sweet readers. Many of you, I have never met, and probably will never meet, yet your presence gives me real joy and genuine fulfillment. So, maybe the better question is how to hold the device without letting it hold me. Maybe it’s as simple as noticing the pull of anticipation, smiling at it, choosing to look up instead.

It’s time to close the apps. One by one, small acts of devotion. The light fades but your mind fills itself. God, grant me serenity from the hollow hours between now and sleep. The light has faded but a trace of it salts your tongue. A half-remembered communion. You spit it out. God, grant me the courage to be alone with my mind. The congregation still hums in the background, but their hymns no longer enchant. God, grant me the wisdom to tell hunger from holiness. Blessed are the addicts, but God, grant me sleep before I reach for the light again.
