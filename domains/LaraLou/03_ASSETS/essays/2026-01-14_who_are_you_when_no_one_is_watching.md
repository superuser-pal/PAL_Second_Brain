# Who Are You When No One Is Watching?

> On self-surveillance, judgment, and the illusion of being watched

Let me stand in the light where you can see me. Sit there, in the dark, and keep your eyes on me. Please just tell me what you see. Spare no details; I want to hear it all. Tell me where I slip up. Count my pauses, my hesitations, all the awkward little moments I pretend not to notice. Add it up and weigh it. Let me know how I did tonight. Let me know if I’m good enough. I’ll say what I practiced saying. I’ll try not to miss anything. If there is something wrong with me, say it plainly. If there is something good, don’t round it up. I want the truth as you see it. I want to know where I stand when the curtain falls.

I have always lived my life with an audience inside my head. They watch everything I do. If a scrap of paper slips from my pocket and I’m too tired to pick it up and put it in a trash can, they boo. Loudly. If I tap a stranger on the shoulder to tell them their backpack is open, they applaud. If I tell a joke and people laugh, they rise to their feet and cheer. And when I fail, when I do something badly or awkwardly or not quite the way I had intended, they throw tomatoes at my face. They replay the scene from different angles, slow it down, make me watch it again. The show never ends early, and there is always time for one more judgment.

I’ve talked to friends about this before. About whether there’s someone inside your head who watches you live your life; an observer, a narrator, something like that, or, in my case, an audience. Most people said yes. Some described a voice that comments as they go, more factual, like a running transcript. Others recognized the audience, just harsher than mine. Others said it felt more like being accompanied by their audience rather than evaluated. But everyone seemed to recognize the feeling of being watched from the inside. I’ve only ever met one person who told me he had nothing at all. No observer. No commentary. I remember thinking that must be a terribly, terribly, terribly peaceful way to live.

I wonder how much of this is taught. I grew up in the Netherlands, in a Catholic part of the country, where the idea of being watched was not some abstract concept but a religious reality: God saw everything. He knew what you thought, not just what you did. Even when no one else was there, you were still observed. And even without religion, there was Sinterklaas (think of him as Dutch Santa Claus) who, similarly to God, knew if you had been good or bad that year. If you hadn’t, no presents of course. Perhaps we’re taught early on that goodness requires an audience, and that even when you’re alone, you are never entirely unobserved.

Maybe this is less mysterious than it feels. Neuroscience has a fairly straightforward explanation for why so many of us feel accompanied by an observer. The mind has the ability to turn back in on itself, like a snake devouring its own tail. A thought happens, and then another thought arrives that notices the first thought. Sometimes an emotion will pop up and, at the same time, there is an awareness of having the emotion, maybe even a response to it: I shouldn’t be feeling this way. In psychology this is called metacognition, which is just a fancy way of saying thinking about thinking. In the end, to know anything about your own mind at all, you have to occupy that second position; becoming someone who watches the watching.

For a long time, I thought this audience was useful, because in a way, it was. It pushed me to do things I didn’t feel like doing. It kept me alert and ambitious. It told me I could always do better, and often, that was true. I worked harder because of it and I improved because of it. But the same voice that urges me forward is merciless when things don’t go as planned. When something falls apart, or I fail, even in a small way, the response is immediate and unforgiving. There is no distance there. No gentleness. Just a flood of commentary that feels intimate and precise, as if it knows exactly where to aim.

Alan Watts once spoke about the illusion of separation. The self watching the self, judging the self, correcting the self, as if there were two. As if one is in charge and the other can be brought under control. As if the watcher is not made of the same substance as the one being watched. In the end, if you live this way long enough, always watched, always watching, you start to hesitate before you act. You rehearse conversations before you have them. You review moments that have already passed. And you begin to experience your life slightly ahead of it or slightly behind it, rarely right where it’s happening. A performance, not for others, but for yourself.

I kept imagining this audience of mine as something slightly apart from me. More composed, more reasonable, a collective voice that knew what it was talking about. But their voice doesn’t come from elsewhere. It only uses my words. They can be ruthless, mean but unmistakably, they all have my face, my voice and my thoughts. That’s the thing: I am not separate from this audience. I am the audience and the audience is me.

Far from being objective, this audience sits in the dark trained on my weakest spots. It knows exactly where to look. They know every insecurity I have, every fear, every single thing that I don’t like about myself. Follow the audience, the judge, whatever version is in your head, and you will start mistaking their judgements and thoughts about yourself for the thoughts that others might be having about you. But here is the great and terrible thing about what other people think about you: Other people’s thoughts are mostly unavailable to you. You will never know, with any real certainty, what anyone is thinking. Which means that it becomes totally irrelevant anyway.

So how do we stop this internal judge from taking over? How do we stop creating a mental cage that we ourselves both build and are imprisoned by? How do we respond with a little more kindness to ourselves? I haven’t quite figured that out yet. Alan Watts said that the self’s attempt to control itself is a kind of confusion, a loop mistaken for a hierarchy. The mind dividing itself into roles and then forgetting it did the dividing. Whatever comes next probably doesn’t start with control, but with noticing who we keep handing it to.

Better to step out of the light. The dark will not answer back anymore. The audience was never real. There was no ledger being kept. No one but me counting my pauses or circling my mistakes in red. I forget what I practised saying, and all the marks have disappeared. There is no final assessment coming. The curtain doesn’t fall because there was no performance to begin with. Just a life, happening in real time, whether or not anyone is watching.
