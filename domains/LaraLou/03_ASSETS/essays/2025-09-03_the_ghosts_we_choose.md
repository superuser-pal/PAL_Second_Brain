# The Ghosts We Choose

> On the ghosts we choose to cradle, the ones that consume us, and the strange comfort of pressing on an old bruise just to feel it ache again

We are all haunted by ghosts. Ghosts are memories. Ghosts are longing. Ghosts are shame, they are regrets. Ghosts are the echo of something that once brought joy, even if it has since turned sour. We keep our ghosts close because we cannot let go yet, or because we don’t want to. More often than not, a ghost is a wish. A way of saying: stay, just a little longer. Haunt me for a while. Don’t go yet. But no matter how much love they hold, a ghost will always do what a ghost does: haunt.

Someone close to me is moving through his first heartbreak. He’s restless with it, pacing the walls of his own mind. Like a surgeon, he keeps dissecting every interaction, convinced there must be a hidden truth lodged somewhere in the soft tissue of their words. If he just cuts deep enough, maybe he’ll find it. But in the end, there is only blood.

I listen, and I remember. My own first heartbreak, the unbearable weight of imagining life without him. How my body felt uninhabitable in his absence. How I carried him like a ghost in my chest, pressing down on my lungs, keeping me company in the worst way. To be haunted was to feel, at the very least, that I wasn’t entirely alone yet.

There is a strange comfort in choosing to be haunted. In looping the memory again and again, even when it hurts, maybe even especially when it hurts. Pain can be a comfort. Perhaps this is why I sometimes take the train and listen to Reckoner by Radiohead on repeat. Just to hurt my own feelings. To press on a bruise, to see if it still hurts, even though I already know it will.

Maybe that’s what it means to choose a ghost, to keep pressing on the bruise, not because you expect the pain to vanish, but because the pain is the last thread tying you to what mattered. The haunting becomes proof. Proof that you loved, proof that you lost, proof that it all once existed outside of memory. To stop hurting would feel like letting it disappear for good. So, we feed the ghost.

Letting go feels too much like forgetting. And forgetting is its own kind of death. Better to live with the ghost than to admit the love has gone entirely. The haunting feels safer than the silence that follows. To keep a ghost is to keep a fragment of yourself, like a child keeping their old teeth in a box, proof that something once belonged to them, even if it no longer fits.

Yes, sometimes we choose our ghosts. We feed them, we let them stay. But other times, other times, the haunting chooses us. It lingers in places we wish it wouldn’t, in feelings that keep resurfacing no matter how hard we push them down. Those are the ghosts I find myself wrestling with lately, the ones I beg to leave, and that refuse.

I’ve been desperate for an exorcism. To wake up unburdened. To have the room finally cleared of echoes. To walk through the house of my life without looking over my shoulder. But how do we rid ourselves of ghosts we never asked for? The ones we don’t want to hold close? The ones we didn’t invite to haunt, how do we make them go?

Sometimes I wonder if ghosts grow stronger the more we resist them. If they feed on our fear, if pushing them out is the very thing that keeps them circling closer. I’ve learned how to live with the ghosts I choose, the tender ones, the remembered ones. But the others gnaw at me differently. They arrive uninvited, in moments I thought were safe. Some ghosts don’t echo love; they echo fear, mistrust, unease.

Not all hauntings are sharp. Some are tender. A phrase that slips out of my mouth the way a friend I no longer talk to once said it. A recipe I repeat with my own hands, learned long ago from someone else’s. The way I fold towels without thinking, my fingers moving the way my grandmother’s once did. These are hauntings I welcome. They keep the people I’ve lost alive in small, almost invisible ways. They remind me that absence is never absolute.

But heartbreak ghosts are different. They demand more. They don’t politely echo; they consume. They pull you back into the bed where you once slept side by side. They sit in the chair across from you at dinner. They live in the songs you can’t bear to hear, in the streets you refuse to walk down. I remember, years ago, after my first heartbreak, collapsing into a panic attack in the middle of our old supermarket. The supermarket was a graveyard. The shelves: headstones in neat, merciless rows. Haunted, I thought.

I want to tell the person I love who is going through his first heartbreak, that he will forget. I want to tell him to put down his scalpel. I want to tell him that the wound will close, that the scar will fade until only a faint line remains. But in truth, this will become one of his ghosts. You don’t forget that first heartbreak. Years later it doesn’t cut the same way, but it leaves its trace. Pain has a way of softening into lesson; one you carry with you, or one that returns until you finally learn it.

We are all haunted by ghosts, but we cannot let them scare us. Some linger, yes, in the corner of the room, in the edges of memory, but all a ghost can really do is haunt. Nothing more. Shirley Jackson once wrote that

> “fear is the relinquishment of logic, the willing relinquishing of reasonable patterns. We yield to it or we fight it, but we cannot meet it half-way.”

“fear is the relinquishment of logic, the willing relinquishing of reasonable patterns. We yield to it or we fight it, but we cannot meet it half-way.”

I think of that often. How easy it is to yield to ghosts, how tempting it is to keep meeting them halfway. But the truth is simpler, and far less merciful. The ghost might be full of love, but it will always do what a ghost does: haunt.
