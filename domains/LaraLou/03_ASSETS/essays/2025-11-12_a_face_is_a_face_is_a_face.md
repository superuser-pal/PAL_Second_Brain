# A Face Is A Face Is A Face

> On becoming vain, beauty and learning to love your face

There’s a stranger in my mirror. She looks like me, but not quite. The eyes are the same, but they sit above sharper cheekbones. The lips are familiar, but beneath them, teeth meet neatly now. The stranger stares at me in confusion. Both she and I remember hamster cheeks and a narrow jaw. She tilts our head, searching for a familiar angle in different light, but the reflection holds steady. The old softness has been carved away. Our face, once held together by bone and muscle, is now also held together by titanium plates and screws. I blink; so does the stranger. We close our eyes. A face is a face is a face.

Some days I don’t recognise my face. It’s not that I’ve just aged or lost/gained weight, it’s that the architecture itself has changed. My jaw was misaligned since childhood and too narrow for the rest of my skull. If I hadn’t fixed it, it would have turned against me with age. Swallowing, chewing, and even speaking would have become increasingly more difficult. I needed to get it fixed, but in order to do it, I had to sacrifice my old face.

The first surgery split the upper jaw clean down the middle, like cracking a walnut, and spread the halves apart with a metal device that clicked wider each day for 3 weeks. I could feel the bones shifting beneath my skin, a dull pressure that sounded inside my head. 2 years later, when the jawbone had grown shut and my front teeth were back together again, they broke both jaws and realigned them. They pinned my upper jaw back to my skull with plates and screws, then closed me back up. It was meant to fix function, not form. It rearranged my face, and, in some way, my sense of self.

After the second surgery, people said I looked “so different,” then rushed to add, “in a good way.” They meant it kindly, but the words landed a little oddly. I thanked them anyway, because that’s what you do when people mean well. The swelling took months to go down. Every morning, I learned the new topography of my own face. Not only the numb patches, the tingling nerves, but also the way my smile pulled differently now.

It’s strange to live inside a face that others prefer to the one you remember. I catch myself thinking in third person now, as if the new face belongs to a character I’m still learning to play. She certainly photographs better. She looks more symmetrical, more composed, more like someone who knows what she’s doing. But she’s also more aware of herself, more conscious of the angles, the lighting.

I used to think beauty was something solid; something you either had or didn’t, determined long before you could tamper with it. But in this day and age, it can be engineered, measured, reconstructed. Beauty has bones. Angles can be rearranged, symmetry bought, softness carved away. I guess it’s true what they say: beauty is pain. Some broken bones, swelling, bleeding gums. Pain traded for beauty. I did it because I had to, but I’d be lying if I said I don’t like the result.

The world has turned beauty into a maintenance plan, and I’ve become a diligent subscriber. Every algorithm reminds me that I could still be closer to perfect if I just tried a little harder. Have you tried mewing? No? What about a little Korean skincare? That will fix those big ugly pores. Fine lines? Have you tried PRP? Thread lifts? Maybe filler? Microneedling? Blepharoplasty?? No?? Don’t you want to be beautiful? The stranger in the mirror nods along, obedient.

I used to think beauty would feel like belonging, but it feels more like performance. It’s a popular performance too, one that people clap for. Our culture treats the body like a résumé, as something to be updated, optimized, constantly proofed against time. There’s moral language in it too. To be beautiful is to be disciplined; to be undone is to have failed at care. Skincare becomes self-care becomes self-worth. Every purchase carries the promise of redemption.

We are being rewired by beauty. The brain has an entire region devoted to faces, the fusiform face area, a patch of cortex that lights up every time we meet a gaze. Feed it enough of the same kind of smooth, symmetrical and surgically neat face, and it begins to prefer it. The more we see it, the more natural it feels. Neural adaptation, they call it. Over time, every other kind of beauty starts to look wrong. We begin to crave the familiar template, to sculpt ourselves in its image. We want to become or be with the women who no longer even look like themselves: airbrushed, filtered, carved, reconstructed. Beneath the glow lie fillers, implants, broken bones, titanium plates.

I used to pity people who chased this kind of beauty. I thought I was immune to it. But somewhere between recovery and reflection, I started to understand the seduction. Beauty, after all, is a kind of currency. It buys grace in small interactions, softens how the world responds to you, it even helps getting out from a ticket. People listen differently when they like what they see. They forgive faster, pay attention for longer. Maybe I didn’t crave beauty itself, but the ease it seemed to promise. Or maybe vanity has taken over just a little bit.

Some nights, I scroll through old photos and I’ll see the weak jaw, the uneven bite, the soft lines I once disliked, and I’ll feel this strange sense of nostalgia. I miss the old face. Maybe not for how it looked, but for how little I thought about it. Back then, my reflection didn’t ask for so much attention. I didn’t study it, adjust it, try to make it behave. It just came along for the day, unremarkable and uneven and puffy-cheeked and weak-chinned and mine. Special, only because it was mine.

The camera opens its eyes; I feed it my reflection. I want to try to make peace with the stranger in the mirror. To stop measuring her against memory. I meet her eyes in the mirror. We both know the script. Tilt. Smile. Look alive. Always turn the left side of the face. Suck your tongue to the roof of your mouth. The mirror holds steady. I search for the girl I was and find the woman the world prefers. A face is a face is a face.
