# To Be Human Is to Look Back

> Why we turn, even when we're told not to. And what that turning says about love, loss, and being human

There is something haunting about a Catholic church. I remember sitting on the hard wooden benches, my back aching, the smell of wax and incense curling in the air. On all sides, saints wept and bled in oil and gold. Jesus nailed to the cross, his ribs showing through painted skin, nails through hands and feet, his skyward eyes cast in agony. It was beautiful in the way nightmares can be beautiful; because even in all that blood and ruin, I couldn’t stop staring.

We weren’t believers. My parents hadn’t even bothered to baptize me. Church was just a habit from a bygone era, a ritual sleepwalking its way through the bones of Sunday. A holdover from generations before. Maybe I was part of the last wave of children still sent there out of tradition, not faith. We recited prayers like phonemes, lit candles without knowing why. It already felt antiquated, even then.

I used to sit in those benches, fingers twiddling the hem of my dress, the wood cold against my thighs, listening to the stories they read aloud from the Bible. Tales of floods and fire, of angels with swords and men turned to ash. I remember how they followed me into sleep in the form of hellish nightmares. Maybe that was the point. Maybe those stories were meant to haunt us. To shape us through fear. Fear of punishment. Fear of disobedience. Fear of sin.

I haven’t thought about those stories in years. But lately, I keep returning to Lot’s wife. In the book of Genesis, God decides to destroy two cities: Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot and his family are allowed to leave, but only under one condition: they must walk away without turning back. No glancing over the shoulder. No pause. No grief. Just forward. But Lot’s wife looks. And for that, for the simple act of turning toward what was burning behind her, she’s turned into a pillar of salt. I keep thinking about that moment. Not the punishment. The looking. What it means to turn around, even when you’re told not to.

We’re taught not to look back. That the past is a closed door, and only fools linger. That forward is the only holy direction, the only direction that affords you survival. But I think most of us go back more often than we admit. Not because we want to stay there, but because something in us needs to understand, needs to run a finger along the outline of what used to be.

There’s a violence in pretending the past doesn’t pull at us. We act like time is a river and we’re meant to float forward with grace, but most days it feels more like trudging through mud, dragging behind us the bodies we didn’t bury properly. Lot’s wife didn’t just look back at a city. She looked back at her life. The crooked bowl on the table, still holding fruit. The neighbors she brought bread to. The sheets still warm from sleep. The things she had once loved, now swallowed by fire. And for that, she was turned into a pillar of salt; preserved in her longing.

There’s another story I keep returning to. The myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. In it, Orpheus loses the love of his life and walks into the underworld to bring her back. He sings his way past the monsters, softens even death with music. The gods make him a promise: Eurydice can follow, but only if he walks ahead without looking back. He agrees, but just as he reaches the mouth of the cave, just as the light breaks across his face, he turns. Just to see her. Just to be sure. And in that moment, he loses her again.

Orpheus doesn’t turn to salt, instead Eurydice is turned to smoke. Dissolves into air and is pulled back under. When I was sixteen, reading this myth in school, it made me furious. Why was Orpheus so stupid? Why couldn’t he have waited a few more steps? Why would he even look back at all until he was far, far away from the cave? But now I think: what could be more human? To love someone so much you’d rather risk everything than not look.

The world likes clean breaks; Burn it down, start fresh, new year, new you. But I think most of us live in the in-between. Half turned. One hand reaching forward. One still trailing behind. The danger isn’t in looking back. The danger is in getting stuck there. The danger is in never letting yourself look, and letting the weight of what you refused to face calcify inside you instead. We probably wouldn’t even notice. We’d keep moving, carrying it like a splinter beneath the skin.

You might wonder how two stories like this could echo each other at all. One from ancient Greece, one from the Old Testament. Different gods. Different afterlives. Lot’s wife turns to salt. Orpheus watches Eurydice dissolve into shadow. Two different stories, bound by the same motion: the turn. Each glance freezes something in place. Crystallizes absence. In the split second they give in to longing, they lose what they couldn’t bear to let go.

I don’t have a perfect answer. Only the feeling that maybe we’ve always been telling the same story. That love and memory and the ache of letting go keep wearing different faces, but the bones stay the same. I used to think the moral for both stories was obvious: don’t disobey a god, don’t dwell in the past or you’ll be trapped in it. But lately, I see it differently.

Maybe the stories aren’t saying “don’t look back.” Maybe they’re saying: You will. You’ll look back even when you’re told not to. Even when it hurts. Even when you know what it might cost. Because we’re not gods. We don’t get to leave whole worlds behind without turning around. We don’t get to start fresh without bruises. We’re people, which means that we love messily, we mourn slowly, we doubt, we remember and, more often than not, we turn.

Because some things ask to be remembered. Some griefs don’t want to be buried. Some parts of us aren’t done speaking. There are versions of myself I need to visit sometimes. People I need to remember loving, even if the love has nowhere left to go. There are endings, still green around the edges, I’m still trying to let ripen into meaning.

Letting go is not clean. It’s recursive. Some days it feels like progress, other days like reopening a wound you thought had scarred over already. Healing rarely moves in a straight line, instead, it loops, backtracks, repeats. We don’t leave things behind so much as learn to carry them differently. The ache softens, but it doesn’t vanish. And maybe it’s not meant to. Maybe that’s what turning is. Not regression, not failure, but a kind of meditation. A way to sit with what never found its place.

I guess that’s why we keep telling these stories. Why we keep teaching them to high-schoolers. Not to scare them into obedience, but to confess what we already know: forgetting is a fantasy. We are creatures of attachment, stitched from echoes and outlines and the ghosts of rooms we still move through. These myths aren’t about failure. They’re about longing. About how even our most desperate attempts to move forward are laced with the urge to go back

Vonnegut once said he loved Lot’s wife for looking. Not because she was brave or wise or justified, but because she was so incredibly human for doing so. I think about that often. About what it costs to look back, and what it costs not to. About how there’s a kind of grace in breaking the rule when it’s love that makes you break it. We don’t turn because we’re weak. We turn because something in us still loves what’s gone. Because devotion, too, has its own gravity.

Maybe that’s what being human is. To be human is to look back. To not move on without looking, but to move on while remembering. To be human is to carry contradiction. To long for what’s gone. To know something is over and still turn back toward it. Turning, even when it hurts. Letting the past trail behind us; light as smoke, sharp as salt.

You will look back. Even when you know better. Not out of weakness, but out of love. Not to return, but to remember. No fire will rain down, no gods will smite you and you will probably not be turned into a pillar of salt or a cloud of smoke. You’ll walk forward, but part of you will turn. Because in the end, to be human is to look back.
