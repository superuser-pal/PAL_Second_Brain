# Time Will Pass Anyway

> On keeping up, slowing down, and making peace with time

The hands of time move gradually but ever so steadily. They taunt you, threaten you. Each tick a drip of water against stone, a seconds-soaked soundtrack to the day you swore you’d spend differently. Before you know it, hours have passed and you are still on your phone. The clock laughs, it gurgles merrily on your half-spent day, unbothered by your regret. You’re on your phone now too, aren’t you? How much self have you wasted today, it asks? Do you even know?

Realizing how much time you’ve lost inside a screen conjures up a specific kind of nausea. For me, it’s not just guilt or shame, it’s something closer to grief. I look up from my phone and realize a whole hour has folded itself out of existence. Most of the time, I can’t even remember what I just consumed; all that remains is this strange feeling of agitation at my own poor impulse control. It’s unsettling, how quietly the hours disappear. And yet tomorrow, we’ll do it again. We always do.

I find myself often wondering what this is doing to us, what it is doing to me - this constant pulling of attention, this micro-disassembly of the self. Focus, once a natural state, now feels like remembering a language I used to be fluent in. To spend hours on something, uninterrupted, has become almost radical. We have forgotten how to live inside the process, how to wait for things to take shape. If an idea doesn’t sprout immediately, we abandon it. If progress isn’t visible within a week, we convince ourselves it’s not meant for us.

Sometimes I wonder if attention has become our most endangered resource. The internet keeps tugging at it with greedy hands, tugging and tugging until even focusing on a minute-long video becomes a chore. What used to feel like presence now feels like endurance. I miss the part of me that could live inside a moment without trying to escape it.

When I write, I feel that impatience most. I’m working on a novel, and sometimes I’ll sit in front of the screen for an hour without producing a single decent line. So of course, it makes me want to leave, to do something, anything else. My fingers start to twitch toward my phone, ready to disappear into that fast, glittering world that has a little bit of everything, all of the time. Lately though, I’ve started doing this thing I call a boredom timeout. When I feel that restlessness rise, I leave the room. I leave my phone too. I go into another room and I’m not allowed to do anything. Not even reading, not listening to music. Nothing. Just me and the boredom.

It’s awful at first. My mind claws for stimulation like an addict denied a fix. It often takes a little time, but after a while, after I’m done thinking about what I’m going to make for dinner, or what I should reply to that one message, or when I’ve looked at the same tired situation from 20 different angles, my mind will start to clear a little bit. Then, in that clarity, the noise will rearrange itself into something like an original thought. The mind, deprived of distraction, begins to dream again. Creativity, at least for me, lives on the other side of boredom.

I don’t do this because I’ve mastered discipline. I haven’t. My attention span has been sold to the tech billionaires, same as yours probably. It has become a fractured thing, stitched together by notifications and the phantom pleasure that follows. But I’ve learned that if you wait long enough through the discomfort, if you refuse to run from the silence, something beautiful has some space to pop up. The mind just needs time to catch up to itself.

That’s the secret most of us forget: the ones who finish are not spared the struggle; they simply keep returning to it. The only difference between me and a published writer is persistence; they didn’t stop when it got hard, they kept writing. They wrote even when it felt pointless, even when they must have thought that nothing would come of it. They kept writing. So will I.

Because the truth is, anything worth building will ask you to become someone steadier than your impulses. You will doubt yourself. You will feel like an idiot. You will question whether it’s working. Keep going anyway. Keep watering the thing even when it grows very very slowly. Keep practicing the skill that seems to resist you. Keep showing up to the page, the canvas, the gym, the conversation, the life you keep postponing for later. You don’t need proof that it will work. Things that are worth having are rarely easy.

Let others chase the quick fix, the viral moment, the illusion of instant mastery. You, you can take the longer road. Choose the thing that might take years. Because years will come whether you do or not. Time does not wait for our readiness. Time only ever asks to be spent, and even though the world sometimes feels like it has gone insane, and your phone is calling your name while the clock taunts you, you get to decide how you spend it.

Some days you’ll fail. You’ll scroll again, waste an afternoon or an evening, fall back into the noise. Forgive yourself quickly. Then start again. Hours are never lost, only spent, and the best thing you can do is to try and be awake in your own life. Presence is the one thing you will ever truly have.

The hands of time will keep moving gradually but steadily. They don’t stop for anyone and they won’t for you. They don’t care whether I scroll or write, whether I show up or run away. They will move either way. The clock will gurgle merrily on our half-spent day, unbothered by our regret. Whether we start or not, the days will keep leaving us. It’s one of the heartbreaking truths about being human.

The only thing left to do is to pursue the things you want to pursue. To go for that wild idea, even if it’s hard. Especially when it’s hard. Even if it takes a lot of time. Especially when it takes a lot of time. The clock gurgles softly in the background somewhere, ticking endlessly, indifferently. I let it. I write another line. The day moves on, and so do I. There’s no better time to start then now, because time will pass anyway.
