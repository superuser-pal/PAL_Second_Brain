# I Was There Once, I Think

> A meditation on childhood memory, and the selves we inherit through forgetting

In the photograph, I am wearing a faded red dress scattered with stars and shells. I’m sitting on my parents’ bed, my legs small against the slope of the sheets, holding my baby brother who is more asleep than awake. He has only just arrived, hours old, and I am not so much holding him as letting him rest against me. His head was still small enough to fit into the palm of my hand. It must have been one of my parents behind the camera. I’m caught mid-thought, two fingers in my mouth, unsure of what is going on. I had gone to sleep as an only child and woke up as a big sister.

I have always been so sure I remember that day. How my dad woke me up in the morning, took me by the hand and led me to the bedroom to meet my new brother. I swear I can still feel my brother’s tiny fuzzy-haired head against my palm. I can still smell his newborn scent. I know I remember, except I also know I shouldn’t. And so, I probably don’t.

When the picture was taken, I was exactly 1 year, 5 months, and 22 days old. The textbooks say a brain that age can already lay down the scaffolding for memory. But the earliest memories we can summon with any reliability tend to arrive later; two years old, maybe three. Anything before that is called a constructed memory: built from the sediment of other people’s stories, from photographs stared at until they convince us we once saw them through our own eyes.

I think about this often: how fragile memory really is. Some moments are our own. Others have been rewritten by the soft interference of other voices; an aunt’s retelling at a family dinner, a sibling’s sharper recollection, the steady drip of photographs. Over time, the seams dissolve. We forget which parts were truly felt and which were stitched in later.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about Memento (2000), Christopher Nolan’s film about a man whose memory resets every few minutes. He tattoos facts onto his skin, scribbles notes on Polaroids, chasing the man he believes killed his wife. In making his body a ledger of truth, he hopes to catch the man he believes responsible, to pin down a reality that keeps slipping from him. But even then the ledger lies. The fragments he trusts are vulnerable to distortion. The story he builds of himself is crooked, rearranged, made unreliable by omission and manipulation. Watching it, you realize the horror is not just that he forgets, but that forgetting makes him pliable. His identity can be rewritten, over and over, without his consent.

Sometimes I wonder if we are all living inside our own Memento. Maybe less extreme, but still stitched together from scraps; family stories, photographs, the things we decide to hold and the things that slip away.The image of me holding my brother is its own inscription, not carved into skin but into memory. My hand remembers his weight as if it were proof. Out of pieces like this, I stitch together a self that is only partly mine.

I once heard in a neuroscience seminar that we are not a mind inside a body, but a body that is a mind. The heart, the gut, the breath, the low voltage of muscle and nerve all speak upward, and the mind answers back. It guesses what the signals mean and the guess becomes the feeling. The feeling becomes how you experience the world. Which is why a belief can calm a pulse, and a smell can drag you backward through time.

If this is true, then every story we tell about ourselves is a performance of sorts. We are speaking from the ghost of a moment, not the moment itself. And still, we build ourselves upon it. A memory doesn’t have to be accurate to be real, they only have to be believed.

Sometimes I wonder who we are without these stories. If you strip away the past, what’s left? We cling to memory as proof that we have lived, but we are not only what we have kept, we are also what we have lost. And the losing shapes us just as much.

Would I still be the same when some details disappear? What if one day I can no longer recall the soft murmur of the morning doves outside my childhood bedroom? Will I still have a strange affection for pigeons as an adult? What if I forget the smell of the freshly picked parsley outside my grandmother’s house? Will I still think of summer and my grandmother every time I smell it? Will green still be my favorite colour if I couldn’t remember my childhood obsession with four-leaved clovers?

What if this erosion never stops, and we are always being remade by forgetting? Like a stone made smooth by the slow patience of wind and rain. A thousand tiny vanishings, until the person we think of as “me” is nothing more than a palimpsest. That’s the real cruelty of time; not that it rushes us forward, but that it edits us as we go, cutting details from the reel until the story changes shape.

And yet, I don’t think the gaps remain empty. They get filled with new impressions. The smell of my grandmother’s parsley might vanish from me, but will live on in my brother’s recollection. Perhaps I will forget about the clovers, but my mother can remind me. This is how we borrow from one another to stay whole, passing pieces of our lives back and forth, trying to cover the holes.

Maybe forgetting is not always a theft but also a mercy. A softening of edges so the past doesn’t cut too sharply when we brush against it. Perhaps I don’t need the exact murmur of the doves, only the knowledge that I once loved them. Perhaps I don’t need the parsley, only the ache for summer that rises in me when I smell it now.

Besides, the body remembers even when the mind does not. Maybe that is why I still swear I can feel the weight of my brother’s head against my palm, the way his tiny body pressed into the skin there, warm and impossibly light.

I will never know for sure if I was there in the way I think I was. But the image has grafted itself to me. Whether by truth or by telling, it belongs to me. And maybe that is all memory ever is, something that once passed through us, now stitched into our fabric so tightly we can’t even tell where it’s been stitched in.

In the photograph, my two fingers are still pressed to my lips. My brother is sleeping. The red dress is bunched against my knees, creased from the sheets. I can’t be certain I was there in the picture. I was there once, I think. But I keep thinking, if the memories I carry are only part mine, was I ever fully there at all? Were you?
