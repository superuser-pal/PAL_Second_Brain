# The Long Way Home

> On adulthood acceleration, time science, and taking detours

The street is a river of amber leaves. Every gust lifts them into brief resurrection before they settle again. Autumn makes a theatre of decay. The trees undress in slow motion, baring their bones to the wind. Leaves curl at the edges like burnt paper. The city exhales in greens, reds and browns. The air smells of endings. I almost take my usual turn but don’t. The street ahead glows gold in the dying light, and for once, I let myself take the long way home.

Most days, I don’t take the long way. I take the efficient one; the one Google Maps suggests, the one that shaves off three minutes. My life, like yours probably, has become an equation of time. I wake up with a checklist already unfolding in my head. My calendar looks like a carefully Tetris-ed puzzle of obligations. Work. Friends. Dates. Writing. Painting. Exercise. Cooking. There’s satisfaction in it, this attempt to make the most of everything. To lead a full life.

There’s a small dopamine rush in ticking things off; another message answered, another hour accounted for, another plan crossed off the list. If I’m honest, I love the feeling of it: the brain’s chemistry firing its approval. But then, suddenly, it’s dark outside. Another day gone, the to-do list wiped clean only to refill itself by morning. The rhythm is addictive, but the cost is texture. Time shrinks. Days fold into weeks and vanish like steam from a kettle. I keep moving, efficient, accomplished, and somehow half-absent from my own life.

The other night, my boyfriend told me he’s afraid of how fast time is passing. We were lying in bed, both of us tired. Another day had slipped by. “It’s like I blink,” he said, “and suddenly a year’s gone.” I knew what he meant. I feel it too; that strange acceleration of adulthood. Days that once felt expansive, full of edges and detail, now pass like a hand waving from a moving train. We measure time in milestones: birthdays, deadlines, weekends, holidays, and everything in between seems to dissolve into blur. It’s not that we aren’t living; it’s that the living has become predictable. Each day folds into the next like the pages of a book turning. Most days look the same: you wake up, go to work, get home, eat dinner, watch something, then go to sleep. The hours are smooth, frictionless. Yet, the friction is what lets us feel the shape of time.

When I think about it, time didn’t always move this fast. As a kid, a single day could hold entire worlds. Afternoons lasted forever, sticky with sun and boredom and possibility. A summer felt like a lifetime. I remember lying on the grass, watching clouds drag themselves across the sky, certain they’d never reach the edge of my vision. Back then, every moment felt thick and specific: the smell of wet asphalt after rain, the sound of my brother’s laughter (the best sound in the world), the way September always carried the scent of pensil shavings and wet leaves. Everything asked to be noticed.

There’s science behind it, of course. Our brains don’t actually measure time, they measure change. Novelty demands attention, and attention leaves traces. Every new experience fires a pattern of neurons the brain has to record and store, and the more it has to record, the denser the memory becomes. Dense memories feel long in retrospect. That’s why a week spent traveling somewhere new can feel endless, while a week spent answering emails barely registers at all. When life becomes familiar, the brain stops bothering to write it down in detail. It starts compressing, folding one ordinary day into the next until months blur together. We call it time passing quickly, but really, it’s our perception thinning.

When we were children, time moved like honey. Everything was new, so the brain, still busy mapping the world, recorded everything in high definition. Every smell, every color, every sound had to be learned, catalogued and stored. They call this the oddball effect: when the brain encounters something unfamiliar, it pays closer attention and forms richer memories, which makes those moments feel longer. No wonder it all felt slower. Our days were thick with firsts, and firsts are how the mind keeps time. Now, the world has grown familiar. We move through it half-seeing, half-hearing, already knowing what comes next.

So, knowing all of this, is there a way to stretch time? To make it feel like it did when we were children? I think there is, though it’s less about slowing the clock and more about learning to see again. I started playing with it in small ways. Taking the longer route, even when it’s out of the way. Buying a piece of fruit I’ve never tried. Going to a new café, instead of the one you already know. Sometimes it’s as simple as looking up instead of down. These little deviations don’t change the length of the day, but they change its weight. It’s like adding texture back to time so that it becomes less slippery.

I think I first saw it on TikTok, of all places. It’s called microdosing novelty: the idea that you can make time feel slower by feeding your brain something it hasn’t already memorised. You don’t need grand adventures or spiritual awakenings. You just need to surprise yourself a little. Each time you make yourself to something new, to notice something you hadn’t noticed before, it forced the mind awake, telling it to pay attention.

So take the long way home. Let your shoes get dirty with the leaves of autumn. Listen to a song you don’t know yet while you walk down the street you usually ignore. Look up. Notice the light changing. It’s strange how little it takes to feel alive again. The world doesn’t have to change; I just have to show up differently. Time will eventually come for us all, and the only way to make it feel slower, is to live inside it.

The street is still a river of amber leaves. They rise in small flurries around my ankles, catching the last bit of daylight before collapsing back to the ground. The air tastes faintly of woodfire, the way it always does in October. A cyclist passes, and for a moment I watch their reflection ripple in a puddle, gold fractured into motion. Everything is ordinary, and yet it feels enormous. The city exhales; I exhale with it. I keep walking. The long way home.
