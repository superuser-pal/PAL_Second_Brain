# New Year, Same You?

> On the violence we call self-improvement

New Year’s Day is a sharp blade, lowered ceremonially. You place your old self beneath it and wait for the drop. As you close your eyes, you whisper to yourself that this year will be different. Life will finally start. You give your old self the final rites, blessing away the sins of the past. You imagine the cut will be precise and merciful; a decisive motion. No gradual bleeding. Just before and after. Just this body and the better one you intend to inhabit. You keep your eyes closed. You believe the cut will be clean.

I’ve always liked New Year’s resolutions. There is something so disarming about the way, once a year, we collectively think how we can be better people. No one agrees on how, of course, and no one does it perfectly. But for a moment, there’s a shared willingness to look at ourselves with honesty. It starts with a wish. A wish for things to line up. For us to match with the ideal version of ourselves that we have created in our minds.

The new year comes with possibilities. Even if it’s arbitrary, that 01-01 on the calendar feels like the perfect place to begin fresh. A new year reads like a wide, empty margin. White space where nothing has gone wrong yet. Where you can imagine yourself acting with a little more clarity. Where you start choosing differently. Where you can finally do all the things you’ve been promising yourself you’d do. Finally, your life can begin.

Around this time, some of you will have made a list. Some of you will have refused to. There are familiar arguments on both sides, and they tend to cancel each other out. You’ve probably seen the thinkpieces on it on Substack already. So, who do you belong to? The optimist? The pessimists? How about the inbetweens? I just know that I wonder why it is so difficult to keep the promises we make to ourselves and what would actually make those new habits stick.

The mind relies on structure it doesn’t have to invent. Dates work because they externalize order. They give the brain a ready-made boundary it can use to segment experience: before, after. This is useful. Memory becomes easier to organize when time is chunked, and decisions feel more manageable when they attach themselves to a clear marker. January first doesn’t change anything materially, but it gives the mind something solid to lean on.

Beginnings also create distance, and distance changes how we remember. When the past is framed as belonging to an earlier chapter, the brain loosens its grip on self-blame. The problem starts when we mistake this cognitive reset for a personal one. We assume that because the timeline has been divided, the self can be replaced. That the self has to be replaced. That improvement requires rupture. That the person who made the old choices must be left behind entirely. We can only start living if we make the cut clean enough.

I can’t count the amount of times I wanted to be someone different. Someone who is braver and more decisive and less affected. In true capitalist fashion I have decided that a change of aesthetic is just what I need to start living my life. Just a few more changes. Just one more clean beginning and I will maintain the perfect streak. I will meditate every day, and dry brush, and do yoga each and every morning, I will sleep 9 hours every single night, I will call all my friends regularly, I will eat healthy every day and I’ll live in the gym and I’ll maintain the perfect skincare routine and I will become someone who always does the right thing, the kind thing, who is calm, and clear, and most of all, someone who is not me. I will not become complacent, not lazy, and if I do, if I cannot make my streak perfect, then I have to start all over. Wait for another perfect time and place to really start living my life.

At some point, the pattern becomes hard to ignore. The lists are rewritten. The apps are re-downloaded. The first day is always clean. The second already wobbles. By the third, it starts to collapse, and the whole thing feels compromised. So you abandon it. Not because it wasn’t working, but because it wasn’t perfect. Not living badly, exactly. Just always preparing to live better later. Always arranging the conditions under which life might finally be allowed to begin. And somewhere in that waiting, you started to believe that this version of you is only provisional. That the real one is still ahead.

What’s happening there isn’t a failure of character. It’s a mismatch between how we expect change to work and how the mind actually operates. The brain doesn’t respond well to all-or-nothing plans. It doesn’t track progress in ideals, but in repetition. It learns through frequency, not intensity. A habit sticks when it can survive imperfection, when it doesn’t require constant self-monitoring or moral accounting. The moment a routine becomes fragile, dependent on streaks, rules, or perfect conditions, it becomes easy to abandon.

Habits tend to stick when they make life feel lighter, not heavier. When they reduce the amount of thinking required instead of adding to it. The mind is drawn to paths it already knows how to walk; it reinforces what fits existing patterns and actively resists what doesn’t. We are more likely to repeat behaviors that feel self-consistent than ones that feel aspirational. Not the habits that promise a better version of us someday, but the ones that make sense with who we already are. Change endures when it grows from recognition rather than rejection. Not new year, new me.

The truth is, you do not need to become anyone else. There is no future self waiting to take over, and there doesn’t need to be, because you are not unfinished. Life has already begun. You are already living it! It can also be so short, way too short. And in the end there is one person you have to be around for the rest of your life, and that is yourself. You might as well stop trying to replace that person and start making peace with them.

You wait for the moment where everything changes. It doesn’t come. The day looks much like the one before it. The same thoughts pool. The same body answers to your name. The blade doesn’t drop. The cut never arrives. The before bleeds into the after, and the hours keep stacking themselves anyway, one on top of the other, while you drink something warm, answer a message, move through familiar rooms, and nothing in particular signals that this is the moment where your life begins. It’s a new year and you are still you.
