# The Mathematics Of Love

> On probability, timing and the invisible equations

Journeys end in lovers meeting. Paths intertwine so that hands can touch and eyes can glance. Threads pull tight across cities and seasons, sometimes even continents and decades. One variable shifts while another stays constant. Somewhere, a hidden formula balances itself. Every wrong turn, every failed romance, every unremarkable day slots slowly into place until the sum resolves, and two lines that once ran parallel converge. All the invisible math aligns, and one ordinary night becomes the axis of everything that follows.

It was a cold Thursday evening in November when I found myself in Brussels for work. Red-nosed and a little starry-eyed, I’d arrived by train a few hours earlier; my colleagues, who’d been there all week, had already left, leaving the city to me. An empty evening stared me in the face. I had two options: buy some Belgian chocolates, run a bath, and watch a movie, or try to score a date. For that night. My friends had called me delusional for thinking I could find anyone half-decent on such short notice.

At nine, I decided to take the gamble. For the first time in my life, I downloaded Tinder. I still don’t know how, but my age range had somehow been set between seventy and eighty. After swiping a small army of silver-haired men left in under a minute, the app concluded I wasn’t real. Undeterred, I tried Hinge instead. Thirty minutes, a panicked scroll through my photoroll, and €14.99 later, I could like to my heart’s content, or at least until I lost faith in the male species, whichever came first.

After ninety minutes, my optimism had thinned. None of the men had convinced me to leave the hotel room, and the idea itself had started to lose its shine. I was already running the bath when I got a notification from the man I now call my boyfriend. We talked for maybe five minutes. I was too tired for ceremony, so I asked for his number, called him, and asked where to meet. He didn’t hesitate. Fifteen minutes later, I was already out the door.

I still think about the odds sometimes. The tiny alignments that had to occur for that night to exist at all. I wonder how many versions of my life were running parallel to it. In one, I stayed in, ate chocolate, and fell asleep to a movie. In another, I matched with someone else entirely. In most, we never met at all. It’s strange to think that a few taps on a screen can rearrange life as we know it. Statistically, it shouldn’t have worked. Against every reasonable fraction, the numbers lined up anyway. One improbable equation, solved by accident.

The numbers are ridiculous when you think about them. Eight billion people on this planet. Eleven million in Belgium. One and a half in Brussels. On Hinge, that narrows to a few thousand within the right age range. Of those, most will never show up on your screen. Half of the ones who do are ghosts, bad texters, or not quite your kind of strange. Then there’s timing: who happens to be awake, active and interested. By the time you factor all that in, the odds collapse to almost nothing. Love shouldn’t work.

Looking back on that night, what strikes me most isn’t how unlikely it was, but how ordinary. Just another Thursday. A hotel room. A phone screen. I was bored. He was free. We both said yes. But that’s the thing about turning points; they never announce themselves. Somewhere, that night, probability gave way to inevitability. You think you know what you’re walking into: a date, a chat, maybe a kiss. I didn’t know I was stepping into the rest of my life.

I hadn’t expected the way I’d laugh until my stomach hurt, or how natural it would feel to wake up next to him. I hadn’t expected that his home would start to feel like mine, or that his voice would become the one thing that could always steady me when my mind spun out. I hadn’t expected all the trips we would take, all the videogames we would play, all the little inside jokes we would create, all the pillow-talks, all the ‘I-love-you-the-most’s. I hadn’t expected how easily my life would start folding itself around his. In short, I hadn’t expected love. Not like this, not so soon, not so sure. Maybe that’s why everyone always says to not look for love, because it tends to find you when you’ve stopped looking.

I used to think that was the point, that love was something that happened to you, a lightning strike; a beautiful accident. But the older I get, the more I’ve realized that what begins by chance doesn’t stay that way for long. Love begins where probability runs out. What’s left is the decision to stay, to keep saying yes to someone. The numbers can only take you so far; they can tell you the odds of meeting, not the odds of lasting. The rest isn’t calculation but faith disguised as ordinary choices: to reach out, to forgive, to keep soft when it would be easier to harden. What matters isn’t how two people meet, but how they keep finding each other in the ordinary days that follow, even as the equations shift, even as the odds rearrange themselves.

It’s time that I turn to you, my love. Every orbit must find its center, and you are mine. I’ve circled around this story long enough, tracing the edges of chance, of timing, of improbable math, and every path draws me back to you. You, who have given me the courage to pursue my writing. You, who have inspired me with your wisdom, ambition and perseverance. You, who have lit a thousand small suns in my heart. You, who are what I would have wished for if I’d known how to name it. You, the fixed point in all my equations.

In 2 days, exactly a year ago, we will meet. You’ll race your bike to the date we planned just 15 minutes before. I’ll walk, excitedly telling my friends that I have a date with a handsome stranger. My brain will momentarily short-circuit and I’ll ask you if you speak Mexican. You’ll smile, graciously. We’ll talk, we’ll laugh, we’ll touch, we’ll allow ourselves the fantasy of one night. Or at least, that’s what we thought. I didn’t know then that you’d become a reference point, the before and after around which my current life orbits.

Journeys end in lovers meeting. That night, not fated, but a statistical error that somehow worked in our favor. A glitch in the probabilities. A miracle dressed up as a coincidence. And yet, here you are. And here I am. A year later, still in awe of the math that led me to you. If our love could be measured — and we already decided that it can’t, since it keeps looping around the infinite universe — its sum would be this: I love you the most.
