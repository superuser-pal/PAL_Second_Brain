# Tender Is The Witness

> How to stay human while the world keeps burning

My pocket holds a small device of war. I try not to open the news in the mornings anymore; I’ve seen enough burning buildings and bleeding children. My thumb moves with a mind of its own, a Pavlovian response to the small device lighting up. In the span of a minute I see a video of a kitten, a violent anti-immigration protest, a meme I send to a friend, a graphic clip from Gaza. I wonder whether I should share it, whether it matters in my small echo chamber of the internet. What am I trying to prove? That I care? That I’m paying attention? I scroll on. The world is burning in miniature on my palm, and I can’t look away. Tender is the witness; we were never built to hold this much world.

Sometimes I wonder if the awareness I’ve gained of all that’s wrong with the world is only fanning the flames of my pre-existing masochistic tendencies. In the morning, I slide an aluminium coffee capsule into the machine and make a mental note to recycle it. I think about Ethiopian coffee farmers and whether this blend was ethically sourced. I turn up the heating a notch and try not to think about carbon emissions. The doorbell rings. A package. Five layers of cardboard and plastic. My mind drags me to the floating island of waste in the Pacific, three times the size of France.

I read somewhere that our nervous systems were never built for constant witnessing. The parts of the brain that light up when we feel pain — the insula, the amygdala, the anterior cingulate — are the same ones that respond when we watch someone else suffer. The body doesn’t distinguish between my pain and your pain; it just registers distress. We were wired for the immediate: a cry in the next room, a hand reaching for help, a fire close enough to smell. Not for a thousand fires flickering through a screen. The brain can’t tell that the danger is far away, so the body keeps bracing, as if the smoke were its own.

Over time, the chemistry of it turns against us. Cortisol and adrenaline leak into the ordinary: morning coffee, morning scroll. Each new image adds another small dose of fear, another ripple through the nervous system. Eventually, the system dulls itself to survive. Psychologists call it compassion fatigue: the gradual erosion of empathy under the weight of too much feeling. What begins as sensitivity curdles into self-protection. The tragedy isn’t that we stop caring, but that the caring begins to cost us too much to bear.

Lately I keep thinking of Socrates, who believed that to know the good was to do it. That ignorance was the root of all wrongdoing. But in this century of infinite knowing, we’ve disproved him entirely. We know everything. We see everything. We drown in knowing. And still, the world burns. Awareness has become its own performance: the curated outrage, the shared infographic, the careful curated caption that signals both empathy and restraint.

I used to work at Greenpeace. For a while, outrage was my profession. Or maybe, even more so, to create outrage was my profession: to turn facts into feeling, to make people care. That was the whole thing. Each day felt like standing in front of something burning and begging others to just have a look. I was young and certain that if people just knew, really knew, they would do something about it. That awareness would naturally become action. But the truth was harder to swallow. People already knew. They knew about the fires, the melting ice, the poisoned seas. They just didn’t feel it anymore. The problem wasn’t ignorance; it was numbness.

To become numb is easy enough. It might even feel like a relief. I used to think apathy was the opposite of caring, but maybe it’s just caring gone stale; the heart shutting its doors for maintenance. These days I try to be gentler with that version of myself. But I also remind myself that indifference is its own kind of violence. To stop looking is to let the world vanish into abstraction. To keep looking is to risk despair. Between those two edges, the modern conscience lives; torn, restless, endlessly online.

If knowledge isn’t enough, what is? As much as I would want to, I cannot change the situation in Gaza. Beyond donating money, all I can really do is witness. To look. To not turn away. But witnessing alone starts to hollow you out. At some point, you have to pour something back in. You have to keep your moral pulse alive. You can start tending to what’s near: your street, your friends, your small square of earth. You cook for people. You pick up trash that isn’t yours. You give away what you no longer need. You listen when someone talks. You do what you can to make your tiny radius of the world a little better, and you fight the apathy that the world infects you with.

On my most cynical days I try to remember that goodness, too, is contagious. That it’s still there if you look for it. In the small, unremarkable gestures: when someone gives up their seat on the tram, when a stranger ties a lost dog to a fence and waits, when a neighbour waters the plants of the woman downstairs who’s in the hospital. It’s a little unglamorous, maybe, but you have to stay kind in a tired world. That might just be how we keep the moral muscle from atrophying; not through spectacle or virtue, but through the repetition of care.

So I will try small things. I’ll light a candle for people I will never meet. I’ll buy that dress I want second-hand. I’ll walk the dog for someone. I’ll donate blood. In the end, you can’t fix the whole world. You can only try to change what you can. And in that trying, to stay soft enough that the world can still touch you.

At night, the small device of war lies face down on the table. The screen glows faintly, then goes dark. Somewhere, the world keeps burning without me. A car passes outside; its headlights wash over the window, blotting me out. When they fade, my reflection returns, faint but haloed by what remains of the light. The world is still burning. Tender is the witness, and still, we look.
