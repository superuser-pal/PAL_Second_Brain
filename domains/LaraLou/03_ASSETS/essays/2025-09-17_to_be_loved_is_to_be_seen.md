# To Be Loved Is To Be Seen

> On the false holiness of being consumed, and the stubborn, ordinary courage of letting yourself be seen

Swallow me whole, lover. Devour me tenderly. Sink your teeth into my skin and gnaw your way to my ruined parts. Don’t leave anything. Keep going until there is nothing left of me, and you and I are one. Take my blood for wine, my body for bread. Let me disappear inside you the way salt vanishes in water. Let the borders blur until I can no longer tell where I end and you begin. Consume me.

I used to think this was love: the holy act of being consumed. I told myself that if I emptied myself enough there would be no friction left between us, only seamless union, and that seamlessness would be love. The less of me there was, I thought, the more of us there would be. A romantic notion; two becoming one. But not a healthy one.

I was once trapped in a relationship where I was the only one who couldn’t tell it wasn’t right. I remember watching a lot of nature documentaries during this time. They always left me torn. My heart could not bear the buffalo calf getting eaten by the pack of hyenas, but in the same way, I couldn’t stand seeing the polar bear lose the sea lion, returning to her cubs, emaciated and defeated.

I knew that I was projecting my own human emotions onto these animals, but I couldn’t help myself. It became an obsession, to create stories in my mind around these scenes. When a young wolf tore out the throat of a little lamb, licking up the gushing blood with tenderness; with passion, I told myself what I wanted to believe: the wolf loved the lamb.

Perhaps I can blame my Catholic environment for this misconception. Turning to scripture in my mind, almost unconsciously, I heard the words from mass: This is my body, given for you. This is my blood, poured out. Love as nourishment. Love as sacrifice. Love as the offering of flesh and spirit alike. And it wasn’t only religion that taught me this. Even children’s stories carried the same message. In Where the Wild Things Are, Max runs away to clawed monsters who want to eat him. He tames them, becomes their king, and they grow to love him. When Max wants to return home to his mother, they wail after him: please don’t go, we’ll eat you up, we love you so. The monsters loved Max the way communion taught me love should be shown: by keeping, by holding, by refusing to let go. To be devoured seemed the truest proof of love.

But consumption, I began to see, is always temporary. Hunger returns. Every time I swallowed a truth or softened a sentence, the moment filled and then emptied me further; each concession dissolved and demanded another. I bent my voice, tucked my opinions away, smoothed myself down, until I could hardly find the shape I once had. The wolf does not keep the lamb alive by eating it; a partner cannot build a life with someone who has disappeared into their mouth.

Over time I saw how uneven it was. Devouring feels like intimacy, but it’s always one-sided: one fed, one diminished. What I had thought was closeness was really just disappearance. Maybe love was never about how much of yourself you could give away, but about letting yourself be seen. Rotten parts and all.

Maybe this is why being truly seen has always felt both terrifying and miraculous. Devouring is easier, in a way. To be consumed asks nothing of you but surrender; to be seen requires you to stay. To sit in the light without disguise. To let someone’s gaze land on you without flinching, without folding yourself smaller to make the sight more palatable.

I think of all the times I tried to make myself easier to look at. Not just with makeup or clothes, but with silence. With softened opinions. With a face smoothed into calm even when my chest was burning. I confused invisibility with safety, mistaking the absence of conflict for the presence of love. But disappearing is not the same as being cherished. A shadow is easy to keep; a person is harder.

What I see now is that love which endures does not ask you to vanish. It asks you to remain. To stand in the room with all your noise and ache and strangeness and let yourself be met there. To be loved is to feel the gaze that doesn’t turn away when you bleed, when you bruise, when you fail to be the easy version of yourself. And it is frightening, this kind of love: a love that asks you to stay unvarnished. The miracle is not that someone would want to consume you; hunger is easy. The miracle is that someone would look, really look, at your ruined parts and still stay. This love demands visibility: to be seen, still whole, without disguise, and to see another without reaching for their flesh.

Love as it turns out, is not a script of blood and bread; it is the opposite of vanishing. It is the ordinary accumulation of being noticed: the coffee made exactly the way you like it, your favorite chocolate bar slipped into their basket at the grocery store, the sweater handed to you when you shiver, the blanket pulled over you when you’ve fallen asleep on the couch. It’s the song sent because it reminded them of you, the book you mentioned once and find waiting for you months later, the glass of water left by your bedside, the hand reaching for yours when crossing the street. It’s them texting they’ve gotten home safe because they know you’d worry otherwise, switching on the small lights because they know you hate the big one, asking about the thing at work you were nervous about without needing to be reminded. It’s the way they can tell the difference between your real laugh and your polite one, the way they kiss the scar you’re self-conscious about, the way they put on the song that always lifts your mood. To be loved is not to be swallowed up; not to be devoured, even tenderly. To be loved is to be seen.

So, see me, lover. Look at me tenderly in the light. Take my spoken truths for sacrament; hold them to your lips like bread. Meet the parts I hide and love them anyway. Love them harder still. Don’t turn away. Keep your gaze until there is stillness between us, and you and I remain two. Bless the ruined parts, and in that blessing let me remain whole. Illuminate me in the reflection of your eyes. Love me. See me.
