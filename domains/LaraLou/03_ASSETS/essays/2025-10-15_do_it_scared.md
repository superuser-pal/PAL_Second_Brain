# Do It Scared

> The difference between being safe and being alive

Fear is a dog. It has learned to bark my name. He waits for me, sometimes, at the foot of my bed. His eyes stay closed, but I know he isn’t sleeping. When he sleeps, he does so teeth-bared, ears pointed. He keeps guard over a kingdom of small unrests, waiting while the night gathers its bones. Starry-faced darkness seeps in through the cracks of the curtains. When I shift beneath the blanket, his tail lifts, a small sound against the wood. He doesn’t sleep until I do.

I’ve lived with this dog for many years. Sometimes it sleeps in my bed with me. Other times it follows me from room to room, nose pressed to my heels. When I write, it sits right beside the desk. When I love, it growls softly, warning me to be careful. We keep close, the dog and I. We’ve learned to live around each other, like bad roommates sharing the same small space. We try not to startle each other anymore. It doesn’t like surprises. Neither do I.

The dog still bears its teeth from time to time though. The other day, it was barking so loudly that I did the only thing I could think of: I called my sweet mother. I’d been walking laps around the apartment, picking things up only to set them down again. I caught my reflection in the window. Pale, wet-cheeked, someone I half-recognized. The kettle boiled twice before I remembered what I wanted it for. When she answered, restlessness gathered itself into language. She listened, like she always does, then said, “Honey (schatje), it sounds like you’re carrying a lot of fear.”

Fear and I go way back. When I was eighteen I went through something traumatic. Afterwards, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I remember thinking that this was something that only happened to war veterans. For years though, I lived with a mind that could no longer tell the difference between actual danger and memory. I didn’t know it then, but the dog had found a way in.

There’s this little peanut-sized structure in our brains called the amygdala. This tiny nut is part of the limbic system, and its job is simple: detect threats, trigger the machinery for survival. When it senses danger, it sounds the alarm in your head and with it, it releases stress hormones, quickens the heartbeat, sharpens attention. It’s fast, ancient, and doesn’t bother to ask the prefrontal cortex (reason) whether the threat is real or not. That’s useful when you’re standing in front of a lion. Less so when you’re trying to answer an email. Both can trigger it though. And mine, for a long time, didn’t know how to stand down.

Shirley Jackson once wrote that fear is the relinquishment of logic, the willing surrender of reason. I’ve always loved that line, though I don’t believe the surrender is ever truly willing. Fear doesn’t erase logic; it overrides it. The amygdala takes control, the prefrontal cortex goes quiet, and instinct steps in to drive. It’s not that we stop thinking, it’s that the body thinks louder. Fear is what happens when reason takes a breath and the animal in us answers first.

Not all fears are meant to stop you in your tracks. Some are simply there to remind you that you’re alive. That something matters. Fear and meaning live close together; one shows up where the other begins. Often, fear is just attention in disguise, your body’s way of pointing toward the things that matter enough to wake every cell. But fear doesn’t want you still; it just wants you awake. It sharpens the world, brings everything into focus: heartbeat, breath, consequence.

There are fears you listen to, and fears you move through. The hard part, the crucial part, is telling which is which. Some will keep you safe; others will keep you small. I’ve spent years mistaking one for the other. The trick, I think, is noticing when fear feels like resistance instead of warning. That’s the one you push against.

The safest life is not always the fullest one. Safety is a closed door with good locks and heavy curtains; nothing gets in, but nothing grows either. I used to think peace meant quiet: no dogs barking in the dark. But this is how you can spend years mistaking stillness for calm and control for comfort. Fear, inconvenient as it is, has a pulse. It means you’re standing somewhere that asks something of you.

The older I get, the more I think fear is just love with its hands shaking. You’re scared because you care, because the thing before you matters enough to lose. That’s what makes art hard to share, people hard to trust, and choices hard to make. You do them anyway, because not doing them would be its own kind of loss. Love, it turns out, is not the absence of fear, but the perseverance in spite of it.

So maybe the point isn’t to banish fear, but to walk with it. To let it sit beside you without taking the wheel. You learn its language: how it barks when you’re in danger and whines when you’re on the verge of growth. You learn to pet it once, tell it you’ve got this, and keep going anyway. Courage is not the absence of fear I think. It’s intimacy with it.

You have to make a little room for the dog. Feed it a little, keep it leashed when you must, but you have to stop mistaking its growl for a command. You do the thing that scares you, not because you’ve tamed the fear, but because you’ve learned to live with it breathing beside you. That’s what being alive really is: not the silence of safety, but the sound of your heart, pounding loudly enough to be heard over the barking.

So, I’ll do it scared. I’ll publish this essay while the dog sits beside me, watchful, patient, waiting for the click of “publish.” I’ll enter a room of people where I don’t know anyone. He’ll follow, of course, nose pressed to my heels. I’ll whisper forevers in the mouth of the man that I love, while the dog growls softly, ears pointed toward the sound of my heart. I won’t let the dog stop me. I’ll do it all anyway. Just a little scared.
