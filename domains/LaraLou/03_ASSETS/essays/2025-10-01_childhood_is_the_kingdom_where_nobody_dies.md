# Childhood Is The Kingdom Where Nobody Dies

> On blanket forts, impermanence, and the long wish to grow up (until you wish you hadn't)

I’m in an open field, the grass waist-high, prickling the backs of my bare calves. Butterflies rise in a burst where my little brother runs ahead of me. Behind, I drag a crooked makeshift sled we’ve just used to slide down the sand dunes. I can feel the rope burn against an open blister in the palm of my hand. The air is golden, thick with the sound of wood pigeons. The tall grass ripples in circles, the wind sketching its path across the field. We are too young to know it, but we’re drunk on eternity, in the vast kingdom of childhood, where no one ever dies.

In those days, nothing ended, not really. Like the grass in the field, everything would bend and then rise again. Yes, the sun set, but it would always return the next morning. The ice cracked thin across the puddles in winter, but by spring the tadpoles came wriggling back. Though almost permanent fixtures on my knees, each scrape would heal itself and be sealed shut. We thought we were indestructible, and for a while, maybe we were.

The kingdom of childhood had its commandments of course. Lost marbles always rolled back, but never in the place you were looking. Stuffed animals had to be loved equally, or they would grow jealous in the night. Band-aids worked like magic, no matter the wound. Popsicles counted as medicine. If you wished hard enough, clouds would rearrange themselves into the thing you wanted most. Parents could not die, not ever, for the simple fact that they were your parents and they had to live until one hundred years old. And finally, as long as you kept breathing under the covers, no monster could touch you.

What is childhood, if not a long season of return? To be small is to trust in the loop: fall asleep, wake up, everything waiting as you left it. Parents in the kitchen, the rabbits in their hutch, your brother down the hall. There’s something magical about being a child. You believe in this repetitive spell without ever knowing you believed in it. It wasn’t magic, only the comfort of repetition, the illusion that absence was never permanent. But all spells wear off, and one day the kingdom shows its edges.

At one point in time, my little brother and I tore down a blanket fort. The last one we would ever make together, though of course we didn’t know it at the time. The pillowy walls sagged, the ceiling folded, and in minutes the whole kingdom we’d built was gone, leaving only a pile of blankets on the floor. I’ve since learned that endings rarely look like endings. They look like blankets being folded and an ordinary afternoon dissolving into the next. The closing of a chapter without realising you were on the final page.

As an adult, I’ve come to realize that goodbyes are rarely awarded. Most of the time you don’t get to mark the ending; you stumble into it later, looking back. You wonder when was the last time you told someone you loved them. What that last kiss was like before the air shifted. What were the last words you gave to someone who can no longer answer back.

Loss in childhood rarely arrives head-on; it comes sideways. When my first grandmother died, I couldn’t grasp what that meant. My family kept me from the casket, shielding me and my brother from her still body. It wasn’t until the first visit to my grandfather, and she wasn’t there with cookies waiting, that I understood: she wasn’t coming back. She was simply gone, and the gone kept repeating itself. Until then, absence had always been temporary. My rabbits escaped their hutch but always came hopping back. This was different. This was the first time the world failed to return what I loved.

After my grandmother was gone, the table at my grandparents’ house felt altered. Her chair was still tucked in neatly, as if she might return. Her teacups still waited in the cabinet, though no one set them out anymore. To be grown up is to sit at the table with people who are missing, their chairs still pulled close. They no longer listen, and they no longer speak. The tea goes cold, untouched, though they once swore tea was a comfort. Nobody explained it to me. I only understood, slowly, that the world could keep going without her. That the table could be full and still missing someone. The kingdom was breached.

It’s sad because I remember my childhood as a long wish to grow up. Now I find myself wishing I could return, just for a single day. To live one of those afternoons that stretched into a lifetime. When a dandelion felt like a thousand little wishes you could blow into the sky, when a single ladybug could stop me in my tracks. Shadows were bigger, hallways seemed endless and each new place was miraculous, not for what it was, but for how much space it claimed inside the tiny map of everywhere I’d ever been. The world, to me, was enormous, overflowing, infinite. I didn’t know yet that it was only because I was so small. That one day the rooms would shrink back to their actual size, and the days with them.

And maybe that’s how it works. The rooms don’t actually shrink, the hours don’t get shorter, the world doesn’t suddenly become less miraculous. It’s us that changes. The bigness drains out of things slowly, the way a balloon loses air, not with a bang, but with a long sigh. Maybe it lingers longer than we think, showing up in the sudden urge to stop for a ladybug, or to slide down a big hill. It’s hard to say.

So, when does childhood end? Childhood is not from birth until a certain age, or when the child puts away childish things. It didn’t end when me and my brother no longer fit on that makeshift sled. It didn’t end when we tore down that last blanket fort. It also didn’t end when I no longer believed that the wishes I made upon dandelions were going to come true. Childhood has a thousand little endings, but none of them are final within the walls of the kingdom. Because childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies.
