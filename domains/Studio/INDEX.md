# Studio

A siloed, high-signal workspace for the end-to-end video production lifecycle. This domain facilitates the transition from raw production scripts to finalized Scaledraw presentations while excluding general brainstorming clutter.

## Current State

Domain created. Ready for production work.

## Key Facts

- **Production Media:** All production media lives in `03_ASSETS/media/`
- **Scaledraw Files:** Files in `03_ASSETS/whiteboards/` are designated for final video presentations only
- **No Brainstorming:** This domain follows the Domain-Driven Documentation principle to prevent context pollution; brainstorming belongs elsewhere
- **Scope:** High-fidelity video production and presentation-ready visual architecture only
