This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## How to Contribute
### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion:

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed description
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)

### Suggesting Enhancements

I welcome ideas for new features:

1. Create an issue with the "enhancement" label
2. Describe the feature and why it would be useful
3. Provide examples if applicable
4. Be open to discussion

### Pull Requests

#### Before You Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
3. Ensure your changes align with PAL's philosophy:
   - Technical-literate first
   - Context over prompts
   - Plan-first execution
   - Pattern-based design (can be introduced)

#### Making Changes

**Skills:** New skills should follow PAL structure:
```
.claude/skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main skill file (uppercase)
├── context_file.md    # Context files (snake_case)
├── workflows/         # Workflow files
│   └── workflow_name.md
└── tools/             # CLI tools (always present)
```

**Agents:** Single `.md` files in `.claude/agents/`:
- Use 8-section structure
- Include YAML frontmatter with name, description, version, domain
- Bind to existing domain

**Domains:** Standard 6-folder structure in `Domains/`:
```
Domains/DomainName/
├── INDEX.md
├── CONNECTIONS.yaml
├── 00_CONTEXT/
├── 01_PROJECTS/
├── 02_SESSIONS/
├── 03_ASSETS/
├── 04_OUTPUTS/
└── 05_ARCHIVE/
```

#### Testing

Before submitting:

1. Test your changes with Claude Code or any other AI Model
2. Verify skills activate correctly
3. Check that agents load properly
4. Ensure documentation is accurate
5. Optional (review the context that is being loaded to the session and/or Agents)

#### Submitting

1. Commit with clear messages (verb + description)
2. Push to your fork
3. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issues
   - Testing done

### Medium Priority
