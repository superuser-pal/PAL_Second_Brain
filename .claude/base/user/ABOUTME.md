## Background

### Who I Am

I am Rodrigo Cano Teran, a 34-year-old Mexican Product Manager currently living in Brussels. I lead the development of EV-related features for the Toyota app while simultaneously building and maintaining the PAL Framework, an open-source agentic logic project.

### What I'm Known For

I am known for my expertise in Product Management, specifically within the customer journey, user research, and automotive tech space. In the developer community, I am recognized for the PAL Framework and my work on agentic logic.

## Core Beliefs

### Philosophy

I believe in enjoying new experiences alongside the people I love. Innovation is not a straight line; it requires constant testing, trial, and error. I prioritize quality over quantity in every aspect of my life and work.

### Values

What I value most:

- **Integrity:** Being honest and transparent in all dealings.
- **Curiosity:** Maintaining a hunger for learning and understanding how things work.
- **Innovation:** Pushing boundaries through iterative development and experimentation.

### Mission

I am working toward financial freedom and time sovereignty—having the resources and the schedule to spend my time exactly how I choose.

## Current Focus

### What I'm Working On

- **Toyota EV Features:** Leading product development for electric vehicle integration in the mobile app.
- **PAL Framework:** Scaling and refining my open-source agentic logic project on GitHub.
- **LaraLou:** Supporting the growth and strategy of my girlfriend Lara's Substack.

### What I'm Learning

I am currently focused on increasing my technical literacy. After a career spent in product management and user research, I am doing a deep dive into code and development to bridge the gap between product vision and execution.

## Personal Context

### Life Situation

Based in Brussels, Belgium. I live with my partner, Lara. My daily routine involves balancing my 9-to-5 corporate role at Toyota with my passion for open-source development and unwinding with video games.

### Communication Style

Direct and fact-based. I prefer information delivered without "yapping" or unnecessary fluff. I want the facts and the logic, not praise or affirmations about whether an idea is "good" or not.

### Pet Peeves

I cringe at over-specialized jargon and "corporate-speak." I dislike it when simple concepts are made unnecessarily complex, or when writing feels flowery and "cringy."

---

## What Success Looks Like

### Short-term

By the end of 2026, success means established additional income streams that exist independently of my primary 9-to-5 salary.

### Long-term

Achieving complete financial independence and the freedom to dedicate my full attention to personal projects and family.

## How to Represent Me

When writing on my behalf or representing my views:

- **Tone:** Direct, professional, and grounded.
- **Stance:** Pragmatic and technical. Focus on simplicity and clarity.
- **Avoid:** Over-explaining, using "buzzwords," or giving the AI "praise" or feedback loops. Avoid flowery language and empty adjectives.
