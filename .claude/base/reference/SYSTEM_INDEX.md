# System Index

> **⚠ This file is auto-generated.** It is a read-only reference of all capabilities across all agents. To update it, run the `map-domain` workflow from PAL Master. Do not edit this file directly — changes will be overwritten on next generation.

> **Source of truth:** Each agent's `.md` file (Section 5: My Capabilities). This index is derived from those files.
