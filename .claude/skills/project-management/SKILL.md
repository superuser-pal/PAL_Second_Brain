# Project Management Skill

Centralized project and task management across PAL domains with bidirectional sync between project files and a master task list.

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow          | Trigger                                                               | File                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Create Project    | "create project", "new project", "start project"                      | `workflows/create_project.md`    |
| Pull Tasks        | "pull tasks", "sync tasks", "aggregate tasks", "gather tasks"         | `workflows/pull_tasks.md`        |
| Update Tasks      | "update tasks", "push tasks", "sync back", "update projects"          | `workflows/update_tasks.md`      |
| Project Dashboard | "project dashboard", "list projects", "task summary", "show projects" | `workflows/project_dashboard.md` |
| Archive Project   | "archive project", "complete project", "close project"                | `workflows/archive_project.md`   |

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a New Project

**User:** "I want to create a new project for the API integration work"

**Workflow:** `create_project`

**Process:**

1. List available domains for selection
2. Ask for project name: "API Integration"
3. Ask for objective: "Integrate third-party payment API"
4. Ask for initial tasks: "Research API docs, Create auth flow, Implement endpoints"
5. Ask for priority: "high"
6. Generate `API_INTEGRATION_PROJECT.md` in selected domain

**Output:**

```
Project created: domains/example-domain/01_PROJECTS/API_INTEGRATION_PROJECT.md
- Status: planning
- Priority: high
- Tasks: 3 open
- Updated domain INDEX.md
```

### Example 2: Pull Tasks from All Projects

**User:** "Pull all open tasks into the master list"

**Workflow:** `pull_tasks`

**Process:**

1. Scan all domains for \*\_PROJECT.md files
2. Parse task sections from each project
3. Filter for `#open` and `#in-progress` tasks
4. Generate `Inbox/Dashboards/TASKS.md` with grouped tasks

**Output:**

```
Tasks pulled successfully:
- Domains scanned: 3
- Projects found: 7
- Active tasks: 12 (8 to do, 4 in-progress)
- Inactive tasks: 5 (1 blocked, 1 paused, 2 backlog, 1 not doing)
- Master file: Inbox/Dashboards/TASKS.md
```

### Example 3: View Project Dashboard

**User:** "Show me all projects and their status"

**Workflow:** `project_dashboard`

**Process:**

1. Scan all \*\_PROJECT.md files across domains
2. Parse status, priority, and task counts
3. Generate summary view

**Output:**

```
PROJECT DASHBOARD

By Status:
  Planning:    2 projects
  In Progress: 3 projects
  Review:      1 project
  Completed:   1 project

High Priority:
  - API_INTEGRATION_PROJECT (example-domain) - 3 open tasks
  - SECURITY_AUDIT_PROJECT (security-domain) - 5 open tasks

Overdue: None
```

## Task Format

Tasks use **checkbox symbols** to indicate status. The symbol inside the checkbox determines the task state.

### Checkbox Symbol Reference

| Symbol | Status | Meaning | Section |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| `[ ]` | To Do | Task not started, ready to work on | Active |
| `[/]` | In Progress | Task actively being worked on | Active |
| `[!]` | Blocked | Cannot proceed (dependency, external blocker) | Inactive |
| `[?]` | Paused | Intentionally paused or temporarily deprioritized | Inactive |
| `[I]` | Backlog | Moved to backlog (not doing now, might do later) | Inactive |
| `[-]` | Not Doing | Decided not to do this task | Inactive |
| `[x]` | Done | Task completed | Done |

### Example Project Tasks

```markdown
### Active
- [ ] Research API documentation
- [/] Implement user authentication

### Inactive
- [!] Deploy to production (waiting for security review)
- [?] Add advanced analytics (paused until Q2)
- [I] Internationalization support
- [-] Add GraphQL support (decided against)

### Done
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Create initial documentation
```

### Section Structure

- `### Active` - Contains `[ ]` (to do) and `[/]` (in-progress) tasks
- `### Inactive` - Contains `[!]` (blocked), `[?]` (paused), `[I]` (backlog), `[-]` (not doing) tasks
- `### Done` - Contains `[x]` (done) tasks

| Location                 | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `domains/*/01_PROJECTS/` | Project files (\*\_PROJECT.md) |
| `Inbox/Dashboards/TASKS.md`  | Aggregated task list       |
| `project_template.md`    | Template for new projects      |
