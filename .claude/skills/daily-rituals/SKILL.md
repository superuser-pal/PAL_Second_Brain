# daily-rituals

Structured rituals that surface system state — inbox health, domain project status, session history, and life context — to help you start, end, and review your work with intention.

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **morning_checkin** | "morning routine", "start my day", "morning checkin", "what should I focus on" | `workflows/morning_checkin.md` |
| **evening_review** | "evening review", "end of day", "evening checkin", "wrap up" | `workflows/evening_review.md` |
| **weekly_review** | "weekly review", "week in review", "weekly checkin" | `workflows/weekly_review.md` |
| **weekly_planning** | "weekly planning", "plan week", "plan my week" | `workflows/weekly_planning.md` |
| **weekly_closing** | "close week", "week retro", "end week" | `workflows/weekly_closing.md` |
| **sunday_ritual** | "sunday ritual", "full sunday" | `workflows/sunday_ritual.md` |

## Examples

**Example 1: Start the day with context**
```
User: "morning routine"
-> Invokes morning_checkin workflow
-> Scans Inbox/ for unprocessed items
-> Reads active PROJECT_*.md files for open tasks
-> Checks yesterday's session log
-> Presents: inbox state, top priorities, suggested focus
-> Creates Inbox/Plan/DD-MM-YY.md with intentions
```

**Example 2: End the day with reflection**
```
User: "end of day"
-> Invokes evening_review workflow
-> Reads today's session logs
-> Summarizes accomplishments and progress
-> Captures learnings and blockers
-> Appends review to Inbox/Plan/DD-MM-YY.md
-> Suggests tomorrow's priority
```

**Example 3: Weekly progress check**
```
User: "weekly review"
-> Invokes weekly_review workflow
-> Aggregates task progress across all domains
-> Reviews inbox health (unprocessed count)
-> Checks project status changes
-> Identifies stalled projects
-> Creates weekly summary in Inbox/Plan/
```

**Example 4: Sunday weekly ritual**
```
User: "sunday ritual"
-> Invokes sunday_ritual workflow (orchestrator)
-> If active week exists: runs weekly_closing first
-> Runs weekly_review for progress summary
-> Runs weekly_planning for upcoming week
-> Creates week file in Inbox/Plan/
-> Archives week and daily files to Inbox/Plan/archive/
```
