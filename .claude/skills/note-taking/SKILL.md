# note-taking

Unified note management skill with semantic structure (observation categories, entity types, relation types) that transforms flat notes into a connected knowledge graph inside Obsidian.

## Semantic Features

- **Observation Categories** (10 types): fact, idea, decision, technique, requirement, question, insight, problem, solution, action
- **Entity Types** (6 types): concept, decision, reference, meeting, braindump, idea
- **Relation Types** (10 types): part_of, supports, contradicts, evolved_from, informs, blocks, inspired_by, relates_to, originated_with, follows
- **Dedup Check**: Detects similar notes before creating duplicates
- **Action Extraction**: Automatically creates tasks from `[action]` observations
- **Multi-Theme Splitting**: Braindumps with distinct themes can split into separate notes

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **braindump** | "braindump", "brain dump", "capture thoughts", "dump thoughts" | `workflows/braindump.md` |
| **process_inbox** | "process inbox", "add frontmatter", "scan notes" | `workflows/process_inbox.md` |
| **distribute_notes** | "distribute notes", "move notes to domains", "organize notes" | `workflows/distribute_notes.md` |
| **ingest_longform** | "ingest PDF", "convert document", "ingest document" | `workflows/ingest_longform.md` |
| **url_dump** | "url dump", "save link", "bookmark url", "capture url" | `workflows/url_dump.md` |
| **export_life_summary** | "export life summary", "life report", "generate life summary" | `workflows/export_life_summary.md` |

## Examples

**Example 1: Capture raw thoughts with braindump**
```
User: "braindump"
-> Invokes braindump workflow
-> Collects stream-of-consciousness input
-> Analyzes for themes, insights, action items
-> Domain Detection (Step 4a):
   - Scores content against all domains (PALBuilder, LifeOS, Studio, etc.)
   - Uses patterns from templates/domain_patterns.md
   - Confidence threshold: >= 60% triggers suggestion
-> If LifeOS detected: also runs category detection (beliefs, goals, etc.)
-> If non-LifeOS domain: sets domain, category = notes
-> If multiple domains match (>= 70%): asks user to choose
-> If no match: presents domain selection menu
-> Saves to Inbox/Notes/topic-DD-MM-YYYY.md
-> Next: distribute_notes to route to correct domain
```

**Example 2: Process raw notes in inbox**
```
User: "Process my inbox notes"
-> Invokes process_inbox workflow
-> Scans Inbox/Notes/ for .md files without YAML frontmatter
-> Prompts user for domain, project, category assignment
-> Adds standardized YAML frontmatter
-> Notes ready for distribution
```

**Example 2: Distribute processed notes to domains**
```
User: "Distribute my notes to their domains"
-> Invokes distribute_notes workflow
-> Scans Inbox/Notes/ for notes with status: ready
-> Moves each note to domains/[domain]/03_PAGES/
-> Adds reference link to PROJECT_*.md if project field set
-> Leaves notes without frontmatter in place
```

**Example 3: Ingest a PDF document**
```
User: "Ingest the PDF in my ports folder"
-> Invokes ingest_longform workflow
-> Scans ports/In/ for PDF, DOCX, TXT files
-> Converts content to structured markdown
-> AI generates summary and key ideas
-> Adds YAML frontmatter with source metadata
-> Outputs to Inbox/Notes/ ready for processing
```

**Example 4: Save a URL with insights**
```
User: "save this link: https://example.com/article"
-> Invokes url_dump workflow
-> Fetches URL content via WebFetch
-> Detects content type (article vs tool)
-> Extracts key insights and summary
-> Auto-detects category (research, reference, etc.)
-> Saves to Inbox/Notes/article-title-16-02-2026.md
-> If tool detected: includes evaluation checklist
-> Next: distribute_notes to move to domain
```

**Example 5: Export life summary report**
```
User: "export life summary"
-> Invokes export_life_summary workflow
-> Reads all 7 LifeOS files (mission, beliefs, frames, models, learned, goals, projects)
-> Generates structured summary report
-> Outputs to domains/LifeOS/04_WORKSPACE/life_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.md
-> Logs export to 02_SESSIONS/UPDATES.md
```
