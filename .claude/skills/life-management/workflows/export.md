```

### Step 3: Log Export

Append to `02_SESSIONS/UPDATES.md`:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Life Summary Exported
- **Action:** Generated life summary report
- **Output:** 04_OUTPUTS/life_summary_[YYYY-MM-DD].md
- **Notes:** Complete life context snapshot
```

### Step 4: Report Success

Inform user:
- Report location
- Summary of what was included
- Any sections that were empty

## Export Options

User can request variations:

### Full Export (default)
All 7 files, complete content summary

### Category Export
```
"export just goals and projects"
```
Only specified categories

### Timeline Export
```
"export updates from last month"
```
Focus on recent changes

## Formatting Guidelines

1. **Use Headers** - Clear section hierarchy
2. **Bullet Points** - For lists of items
3. **Tables** - For statistics and counts
4. **Horizontal Rules** - Between major sections
5. **Timestamps** - Always include generation date

## Error Handling

- **Empty Files:**
  - Show "(empty)" in the report section
  - Include in statistics with count = 0
  - Add note at end: "Consider populating: [list of empty files]"
- **Missing Files:** Create file from template, note in report
- **Output Directory Missing:** Create 04_OUTPUTS/ if needed
- **Previous Export Exists:** Don't overwrite, use unique timestamp (add _1, _2, etc.)
