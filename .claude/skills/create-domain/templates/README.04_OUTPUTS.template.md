# Outputs

Markdown files and deliverables created by the agent at user request.

## Purpose

This folder contains generated content and deliverables produced during domain work. These are the results of agent work, not inputs.

## File Naming

Flexible - no strict naming enforcement. Use descriptive names.

**Examples:**
- `final_report.md`
- `generated_documentation.md`
- `export_2026-02-11.csv`
- `summary_q1.md`

## Usage

- Store agent-generated content here
- Completed outputs can be moved to `05_ARCHIVE/` when no longer active
- Reference outputs in INDEX.md when relevant
- Use descriptive names that indicate content

## What to Include

- Generated reports and summaries
- Documentation created by the agent
- Exports and data outputs
- Deliverables for stakeholders
- Any content the agent produces at user request
