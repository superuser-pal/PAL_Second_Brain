# Assets

Reference materials from external sources - raw documentation, data files, PDFs, images, etc.

## Purpose

This folder stores external reference materials that support domain work but are not generated by the agent. These are inputs and resources, not outputs.

## File Naming

Files must use `lower_snake_case` format (any extension).

**Examples:**
- `api_documentation.md`
- `design_mockup.png`
- `requirements_spec.pdf`
- `sample_data.json`
- `competitor_analysis.xlsx`

## Usage

- Store documentation, specifications, and reference files
- Include images, PDFs, and other non-markdown files
- Keep original filenames when appropriate (convert to lower_snake_case)
- Reference assets from projects and context files

## What to Include

- External documentation
- Design files and mockups
- Data files and samples
- Research and analysis
